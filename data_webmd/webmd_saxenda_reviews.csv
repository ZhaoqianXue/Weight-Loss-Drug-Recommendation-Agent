I had a headache for approx 36 hrs and have also changed my dosage time to the morning instead of the evening due to the insomnia effects. Changing the timing has helped.  One major concern is a very dry sore throat which appeared 24 hrs after initial dose. I am monitoring and may have to halt the medication if this side effect doesn't subside."
Liraglutide,Saxenda,5/20/2024,Marguerite,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,30lbs lost in 8 weeks no side effects. All food cravings gone and no longer thinking about food. It’s hard to comprehend. Eve if there is something I would normally crave next to me it doesn’t occur to me to have! Have had a few family and other events and have enjoyed something to eat and drink but have stuck the rest of the time to a low cal healthy and structured eating plan and when I have been out etc have not gone overboard and tried to make better decisions the rest of the day. Getting into a 3 meal healthy routine is key for me as I want to be able to sustain once I stop using the drug. I am currently walking 10k steps a day but now am going to introduce some new activities to mix it up.

Now I use 1.2 mg ( my max dose- I guess) still no appetite, still a bit nauseous and no special diet or exercises( except of work as a nurse at the hospital ).For constipation (which has always been my problem) I take prunes and raw fruits, tisaines.
My BMI was 31,5( 20 kg - overweight).My weight goal is 60 kg . Then I plan to stop and continue reduced calorie diet( I learned to eat now much less-about 1/3 of my previous ratio, but I eat everything as before).Now pain in knees and feet, stress incontinence , stomach discomfort (GERD), bloating, gas - all these decreased due to this treatment. I' m quite satisfied, as before nothing worked : tried some diets and exercising which was too hard on my legs , back and stomach.
Glad,I have now this weight - management tool."

Started with .06 mg and increased .06 mg each week until the max dose of 3.0 mg was reached and ultimately completed on 1/15/24. This drug and any accompanying side effects were USELESS. It did NOT decrease my appetite. In fact, I believe it INCREASED my appetite. I exercised and I made healthy food choices at least 90% of the entire time I was on the drug. ZERO weight loss. I either maintained the initial starting weight orgained a few pounds. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. I informed my physician this drug didn't work for me back in 2021, but she insisted I try it again. FAILURE! Now she's wanting to try either Zepbound which my insurance probably won't cover, or Wegovy which NONE of the pharmacies in my area have or can keep in stock. #frustrated"

I'm 100% confident without this medication I would not be able to manage my normal food cravings and eat less because I'm full faster. As per the instructions, I'm on a calorie reduced diet (1,000-1,000 per day). No particular exercise routine (I'll deal with that later). This pill is not magic, it is a tool. You need to do the hard work to count calories."

I simply couldn’t eat. 
So I started back weight training and realised my training meant nothing without proper nutrition.
I also concluded that the willpower to eat correctly and go to the gym consistently was way less than the willpower to continue feeling awful every day.
So back to training 5 times a week and eating regularly and properly, keeping the diet clean and feeling a lot better.
In a weird way it helped by making me compare the two options and I have to say that the gym and nutrition option is by far superior."

I experienced side effects from the start.
Yes it curbs your appetite, but one small 
meal every couple days, that's not healthy.  I found even drinking water was an effort.  The constipation was the worst that I have ever experienced. 
I needed to get a chemist enema product to unblock the brick that was lodged in my colon! 
The non empyting of the stomach  leads to nauseating burping of rotten egg gas, and unstoppable diarrhoea, so much so I needed to wear panty liners.
The last two doses coinciding with a weekend, left me bed bound and miserable.
I understand the premise of this medication, but if vomiting is the only way to get relief from the food sitting (fermenting) in your stomach and I'm talking about light food like watermelon 3 days later and it makes you so sick, then this drug isn't for me."

I notice a bit more nausea, but nothing unmanageable. I had more gastrointestinal issues with Metformin. I have lost 10lbs already and my cravings have been cut drastically. I see many people on here complaining that are NOT taking the medication correctly. If you take too much, too quickly then of course you will have more severe side effects. So far, I am very satisfied with mySaxenda experience."

After that I started getting stomach pains then it went to my left flank and down into my pelvis went to hospital and they explained a few of the side effects of this medication was urine passage and the effects on my gallbladder I was having to take pain killers regular. Of a night my stomach felt like it was full of water but then I had to suddenly go tothe bathroom and would have very loose stools I’d be going 3/4 times a night at least I’d have the urge to vomit. I ended up stopping this injection and it took a few weeks to get back to normal. After 2 months I tried again and after 1 dose all these side effects returned straight away.  Yes it worked in inch loss but these side effects are ridiculous"

I have been bloated for 5 weeks. I give my injection just before bed. Some indjestion and gas but worth the uncomfortableness. I missed 2 injections on the weekend but had no issues with Continuing with my dogs. All the side effects are dissipating and I am feeling so much better. When I eat I feel bloated which is part of the medication. Hoping to lose another 15 pounds in the next two months. So far uncomfortable but rewarding.

I started at 109 kg and now weigh 89 kg, so I've dropped 20 kg in total. 
The first month had some light side effects like nausea and fatigue. Do not worry if you start having side effects again after a few months, my doctor advised me to reduce my dose to 1.8 for two weeks, and it worked. Now I am back on my full dose. 
I am really happy with my results and I will continue to use it until I reach my goal which is 70 kg."

I will be honest the side effects can be harsh and cant seem to get my dose higher that 1.8 as it makes me feel really sick. I get very hot during the night, headaches, lethargic and alot of nausea but for me its worth it for the weight loss (after baby num 3 and hitting 40 next year) my portion sizes have halved as I physically feel full after a small dinner. Its expensive but worth every penny. I dont use a gym and try to walk the sea front at the weekend. I work full time and do not have time for myself, my weight loss probably could have been more with exercise but I am very happy."

I have stopped increasing the dose at 1.8mg as it's working fine and I've lost 6kg in a month.

I have had some mild side effects but the good thing this both of these encourage healthy behaviours.

1) Nausea means you eat less
2) Dry Mouth means you drink more water

3) Also Harder stools, but not constipated.

Final note is that please don't binge drink on this unless you want to vomit (either on the night or the morning after). I'd suggest you skip the day's dose if you plan on this."

I get a little nausea on the first day of the dose increase, but no other side effects so far. I am down to 75kg ! Keep your meals small and healthy and you should have minimal side effects. I have no sugar cravings, even tho they were bad before, as i am in menopause. I am so grateful for this drug. It really is a gift ! Just needs to be easily accessible on the NHS. This could help so many people today, not having to wait 2 years on the NHS Waiting list. It gives people a chance to save their lives and make positive changes to their eating habits. Surely that will save money down the line. Heart disease is rife in my family. For me, this is life saver."

I have lost 13 lbs from starting point of 288 lbs.  Some unpleasant side effects, the worst of which have been frequent dizziness and loss of energy.  I believe that is largely my fault as I have not made myself eat enough to keep my blood sugars in range.  I am pleased with the result so far and will be moving to the stronger Waggovy product next week.  The shots are easy to administer and tolerate, but I have had one needle in a box of 100 (so far)that was dull and very unpleasant.  After a stick that pained me, I moved it to a second site and tried again but it wasn’t any better there so I got twice the pain for one shot.  What fun!"

Woke up in the night and violently vomited and diarrhea for several minutes straight for 3 separate episodes that night within time span of 6 hours.   In one episode I fainted and fell off toilet and banged head on wall to wake up naked on the floor and stood up just to continue throwing up.  Even spit up blood in each instance.

I’m starting on week 3 now with the 1.8 dose and I don’t think I will progress past that amount.  The medicine has completely taken away all food cravings, which has always been my biggest struggle.  I don’t feel hungry and usually have to make myself eat.  I’ve been doing a light snack in the morning and eating whatever I want for dinner.  I eat about 1/3 of what I used to in one sitting, which has been great.  If I eat anymore than that, I find thatI feel uncomfortably full and nauseous so this forces portion control on you.  I’m down 6 lbs in 2 weeks.  Started at 170 and this morning I weighed in at 164 so that was very exciting for me to see.  Regarding side effects, they have been minimal and manageable.  I have had dizzy spells and some nausea.  I am very pleased with the experience so far.  The fact that I don’t feel hungry and the mental block to food cravings has been the biggest help."

I have always had problems with my weight and over eating. I've successfully lost weight time and time again never to maintain it for more than 12 months. 

This is the heaviest I've ever been & I just feel so ashamed every day. I've stopped socialising and I feel like I am missing so much life. I'm 5'3 and my starting weight is 106kg (233lbs) I was 110kg and lost 4 kilos by myself before starting the meds and I've lost 3kg (6.6lbs) in the first two weeks on Saxenda. . I started on the 0.6 dose the first week and went up to 1.2 the second week. I went back down to the 0.2 dose at the start of my third week as I found the fatigue too much to handle with the higher dose. I also found that I just wasn't eating enough at that dose and was dizzy, really cranky and just felt awful in general. 

I've had a little bit of nausea nothing major and it has slowed down my bowel movements where I may have to try and figure something out to get back to having a proper bowel movement each day. 

The biggest thing I have noticed is I am not snacking at all. The food chatter in my brain that has always been there has slowed down so much. I still think about food but have no desire to snack and even if I wanted to I physically can't eat it as I feel so full. My portion sizes are now at a proper size and I feel like a normal person that can manage my eating which is just a huge thing for someone that has felt so ashamed her whole life. I hope that I can continue on the lower dose for a while I don't really want to go back up again. 

I paid $387 AUD and I haven't finished my first pen yet so I think it may work out less expensive that I initially thought it would be at that price per month, especially if I can stay on the lower dose. The injections do not hurt at all but I do have yellow bruises on some of the injection sites. If you are on the fence about starting and the cost I would say its worth investing in yourself! I hope that this medication may be subsidised in the future for people who can not afford it, I feel very lucky that I was able to pay for it.

I will update again at the 3 month mark as I loved reading all of the reviews when I was looking into it."

Was almost down to one meal a day. Lost 4lbs. Week 2 I moved up to 1.2mg and was so poorly. Sickness and diarrhoea! So I’ve gone back to 0.6mg as it was working for me. I may try to up it again for week 3. But I’ll need to make sure I eat as I think the one meal a day probably didn’t help with the nausea. 
I’d recommend this as a weight loss tool."

Taking the medicine on the 1st day I felt underwhelmed as I had no immediate signs of the medication working, in fact I ate my dinner as normal and wanted more. I thought I would be one of those people that this medication didn’t work for. Im now on week 3 and lost 11lbs, I’m so happy with it. Im not following the incremental increases. I’ve only upped the medication to 1.2mg and will only up it again when I think my body needs it. I always eat at every meal time which I think has prevented sickness, I have a banana for breakfast, something very light for lunch 200cals and then a smaller portion of dinner, whatever the family are having.

Could have lost extra weight if i had kept up with excercises over the past month but due to family issues I had faulted slightly. 

It's expensive but I highly recommend it for anyone who is motivated for self improvement. Also recommend dry brushing, skin oils and collagen because weight loss is rapid.... keep that skin healthy so it snaps back!"

I was a bit ill and couldn't do my exercise as I used to and still lost this huge amount. 12k a day walking is helping but I think some sport will shed the pounds even quicker. Feeling much happier and relaxed with less to carry around. BMIwent down to 30 and I have much more energy. Injections are easy and when you buy the first set, you get lots of information, which is very helpful too.?
Felt some nausea but manageable, actually very helpful to not overeat. Your body will tell you what you need and when to stop eating. Haven't had any other side effects but stopped at 1.8 ml injections as this helps enormously, don't think I have to increase the dosage.

It doesn’t control cravings at all but it does make you very tired. I am a compulsive eater, which means feeling full is not something that will stop me from eating. What my brain is telling me and how full my my stomach feels have never matched up, and this med doesn’t have any effect on that. Basically it’s useless trash.

I followed the steps religiously and hardly ever exercised but reduced my food intake dramatically.

I've gained 20 lbs back in the last year, so I'm on my second round now. Lost 7 lbs in the last month but I'm really slowing down the dosage increase to once every two or three weeks. Really believe that you have to find out what works for you and stick with it."

I started taking my injections as prescribed and in the beginning would feel tired immediately after taking it. Eventually m body got used to it and it doesn't cause the sleepiness it once did. However it continues to cause chronic constipation. This lasts for days on end followed be a flood gate opening and me living in the bathroom while my body decides that everything must go all at once via bm. Although I'm unfortunately used to these horrible side effects they can come at very inconvenient times like while in the grocery store or while at the hospital visiting someone. I started taking saxenda in mid July 2022 and it is now mid January 2023 total loss has held steady at only 15 pounds and it hasn't gone down any lower. Appetite is poor and I have to be reminded to eat because the injection killed my appetite. I wouldn't recommend this medication.

I tried Saxenda a few months ago and the side effects were horrible, I stopped using it after two weeks because of the constipation and nausea. My wedding is in two months, so about a month ago I went back to my Doctor who gave me another script for Saxenda. I was desperate, despite consistently eating clean and exercising twice a day, I didn’t lose any weight. I was not obese, I weighed about 158 pounds - which I merely found uncomfortable. I am halfway through week 4 and I’ve lost 15 pounds and I hardly have any side effects! The side effects drastically reduced after week two. I am fairly active, I make my 10k steps a day and go to the gym about 3 times a week now, and tbh - I did not exercise at all the past two weeks, during the holidays. I inject in the morning, drink plenty of water throughout the day, and then have one nutritious, balanced meal at night consisting of nutrient dense veggies and protein. :-)"

I bought the medication directly from the pharmacy after a consultation with the pharmacist. I am in the obese category and have also struggled with food cravings. I constantly over eat and binge. I have lost weight in the past but it is a constant mental battle which has a massive effect on my mental health. I can honestly say that at day 4, I am barely even thinking about food. So much so that I have only been eating 1 meal a day! The first2 days were bad with nausea (I have started on the recommended dose of 0.6mg) but yesterday and today I have felt absolutely fine. But I am not craving chocolate, junk, takeaway and the constant thought about food has gone. I think I am also feeling fuller quicker when I am eating or maybe I am just more mindful of what I am eating. I even went shopping earlier and the junk food/chocolate aisle didn't even phase me. There is nothing that I 'want' for. I never thought that would be possible for me and I hope it lasts as my next step was surgery. I'm happy to pay the £250 a month for this if it continues to get rid of my cravings/need to over eat.

I’m 6 ft 2 in and started at 274.  Down to 260 and its been 3 weeks.  I’ve had no side effects and definitely now know what it feels like to be full.  If you over eat it does not feel good so you just don’t and the cravings for all the bad food just disappear.  I’m almost never hungry anymore after being always hungry my entire life.

I have to force myself to eat small meals. I just don’t get enjoyment from them anymore. I’m hoping to lose another 10-15 kgs and I can already tell it’s going to be an absolute breeze!

No appetite with bloating at first and then improved.  Increase to 1.2 and have had severe stomach cramps, fatigue and no desire to eat or do anything.  I barely eat and I do not believe that this is a good thing. I walk 2 miles a day and then ride my bike 2.4 miles a day Monday - Friday but am pushing myself to continue to do so.  I also try to eat, but very little as it makes me nauseous.  I am down 10 pounds. After reading other reviews, will drop back downto .6 as I was not hungry at that level and hope that the side effects will decrease.  Only increased to a higher dose as it was what was prescribed.  I think the key is to increase when the drug stops suppressing your appetite.  Listen to your body as this is supposed to be an aide not something you live through.  Will post in a couple of weeks with my progress."

Yesterday, I had mild stomach discomfort (it was just gas).  Today, I have a very light headache and a tad constipated.  I'm going to have some Miralax when I get home, and that should take care of the constipation.  I'm definitely not hungry, and have been able to fill up on a handful of raw veggies or just a salad.  I'm drinking more water than I normally do, and I think that's helping keep the normal side effects [that people have mentioned] at bay.  Given that I started the day after Halloween and we have copious amounts of candy (and I normally have a huge sweet tooth), I haven't craved or wanted even one piece.  I'm excited to see the results of this.  I've seen a variety of pounds lost per week from several people, and I should be down to my goal weight by 1/18/23 at the fastest rate or 2/15/22 at the slowest.

I should have weighed myself when I started, but I did not weigh myself the first week.  Since the beginning of week 2, I have lost 8 lbs.  I have no side effects.  I do not specifically exercise, but my evening activities often include walking, lifting and carrying heavy items.  I have not been following a specific diet but have been noticing that I eat much less at meals because I feel fuller faster, and much less often than I did prior to Saxenda as I do not get hungry as often.  One strange thing I noticed is that pork products now make me feel wrong (I don't know how to describe the feeling, but not nauseous), so I am no longer eating pork products.  I also notice that my nighttime snacking is much less. I found it hard to give myself a shot at first, and it still makes me a little uneasy, but the good results keep me going. I am now wearing pants that have not fit in 2 years.  I also feel Saxenda is training me to eat less at meals and eat less often for the time when I no longer am taking it.  I am looking forward to losing more weight and would recommend Saxenda to most people who need to lose weight."

The 1st dose I noticed i was not as hungry that day.  Then as time went on the obvious curb in apatite was not as obvious but I began to realize my after dinner tv time eating was just habit not hunger. Last 2 weeks were long weekend at the lake and another was a birthday calibration and I gained 5 lbs in 2 weeks because I chose to eat and drink excessively. It works but you have to do your part andyou have to want to loose and be willing to make changes in food consumption to achieve your goals. It is an amazing drug if you have struggled with weight loss and really want to loose I would recommend trying Saxenda and I used WW along with it as a program to help me make healthy choices. The Saxenda helped curb my apatite and WW helped me make good food choices and account for and track what I am eating. I'm now down 38 LBS about 10% body weight  and can feel the difference. FYI I'm over 60 and have not yet started to exercise.

You start off on .6 go up by .6 milligrams every week at maximum. If you're having side effects, then continue on the current dose until those symptoms subside. If they don't subside then this medication is not for you as your body is not reacting properly. I've been on this for just under a month and I'm at the 1.8 mg. I noticed definitely that I am eating a lot less and I'm down about 8 to 10 lb or so. WhenI ate too much I did get a little bit of nausea. So I'll give you one guess what I did the next day, that's right, I ate less. If you're using this medication and you're getting black stools or can't get out of bed or anything like that... STOP TAKING IT. Listen to your body. It happens to work for me and I'm very grateful for it. I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes. I'll post another review at the 6-month mark!"

First I was on Victoza which did not let me lose much weight. Then my doctor recommended Saxenda. I started taking Saxenda in February 2022 and now it is August of 2022 and I've already lost 36 lb. I will be honest I do not work out unless you count chasing after a one and a half year old. I'm very pleased with this product. My weight started at 283 pounds and I am now down to 246 lbs. I believe if I was to work out I would lose a lot more. And honestlyit is very easy to take even though it's a needle it's very small it's just 6 mm. It does suppress your appetite but at the same time it does not make you feel yucky at all. I have had no side effects.

For the first weeks the only real side effect he had was severe fatigue. He was napping everyday which is not like him but also no amount of naps and sleep overnight would make him feel better he was like a zombie. Then when that subsided, diarrhoea and sickness started (everyday). He was vomiting like crazy it was almost as if he had a crazy virus. I told him to stop the injections for a few days and see if the poorly feelings stopped and they did, he was back to normal. He then took another injection after 3 days and the sickness started again half way through the day. It’s such a shame because they were working so well for him and for someone with virtually no metabolism it gave him such a boost, but he’s had to stop altogether now as the constant sickness was doing him no good mentally."

I was very apprehensive about the needlepart but I literally couldn't believe how small it was 4mm, and I barely even felt it. Absolutely painless!!. I hope moving up doses goes this good. I will be under 200 in no time."

I took it for one month, increasing my dose each week when I got the onset of severe diarrhea that lasted all day and night. A week later I got really bad vomiting. I called my Dr. who told me to reduce my dose for a few weeks and then increase slowly. I did that and after 2 weeks I experienced severe vomiting episodes again. I have officially stopped. While taking it I exercised and ate a healthy diet and drank plenty of water. I guess my body had an adverse reaction to it."

I weighed myself after 2 weeks and was 89kg, I was probably 92 when I started but I was nervous of weighing myself.  At the beginning of July, I am now 74kg.  I’m 48 years old, female, and have been a yo-yo dieter since my teens.  Sometimes quite slim but usually overweight.  I tried my usual route of low carb but I couldn’t get into it.  Saxenda has given me control over my eating.  I feel like myself again, I look much better, and I have energy.  I’m not starving myself at all, just eating healthily and walking more. The first couple of days I felt a little queasy and for the first 3 weeks I felt a bit constipated, but my body got used to it and now I feel great. I would like to lose a little more weight to put me in the healthy bmi range.  The weight loss has slowed down but I’m still losing a kilo a week on average  which is perfect.  I’m very happy with this, I would then like to move to a lower dose or something else to help me keep at my ideal weight."

The side effects are only a dry mouth and a metallic taste, but to get rid of them I drink a lot of water, which is nice. I started with a weight of 213lbs and in a week it is already 208lbs.

Started at 0.6 dose and have increased 0.6 each week with minimal to no side effects.  This drug works miraculously for me.  I had a voracious appetite before taking it and now I basically have to force myself to eat.  Not counting calories per se but this goes great with my intermittent fasting plan.  I guess range from 800 to 1200 calories a day.  Drinking water and taking a fiber supplement staves off constipation.  So far so good onthis drug and hopefully when I stop taking it I can keep the weight off.  Hoping to get down to 180 in 5-6 months.  Patience will pay off.  I highly recommend Saxenda to obese people that are pre-diabetic like me.

I eat a whole cucumber for breakfast , an apple and banana for lunch and a normal meal in the evening ( do not have large portions especially potatoes but as much greens as you want ).

Thus far I have not had any significant side effects bar occasional light headedness.

I have only been on Saxenda a week and from day one I started straight back on my low carb diet, it really helps cravings for junk food. I was a bit nauseous and dizzy but started taking additional electrolytes which really help. I am posting this review as the only side effect I have is I am very bloated to the point it is making me self conscious, and want to see if others have this, I will eat more nuts as fibre to see if that helps."

Week two after consultation with my doctor I increased to 1.2. Now with a strick intermittent fasting routine (no food between 8pm and 12pm. Lunch with carbs/afternoon apple/all protein dinner) I've dropped 6 pounds. I find that my lunch is all the food I can eat and struggle to eat a small dinner. I'm FULL after lunch. No side affects other than a slight nausea for about 15 minutes after injection but I think that's more low bloodsugar because of no food. 1.2 is perfect for me and the more weight I lose the more active I can be. Right now just walking but it's working for me.

It has suppressed my appetite from day 3. I no longer eat giant meals as a standard meal is now more than enough.
I have changed my diet to exclude fast foods and junk food however I have become far less active. Exercise was zero as I was on the tools but now a manager on a desk.

No side effects whatsoever I have always swam 3 times a week and walk the dog that's my normal life ' I though the injections would begin to drop me weight but no !!

had awful burping and wind but I soon realized that I ate very little starchy carbs specially in the evenings,  I would be fine.

Liraglutide,Saxenda,4/11/2022,Scrappy,65-74,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,3,3,4,2,1,0,"This is a mixed review but in the end I will not continue on Saxzenda. I began the injection a little over a month ago, moving from .6 to 1.2 mls over two weeks. At first I thought things were great as I lost almost ten pounds during that time. As soon as I went to 1.8 things began to go downhill as nausea began and I had very little appetite. When I went to 2.4 I could barely eat anything I was so nauseated 24/7. I wanted my appetite to lessen but not like that. In one 24 hour period it was sobad I had nothing to eat. Even trying to eat a piece of biscuit I’d spit it out as soon as I began to chew. In addition, over the last two weeks since increasing to 2.4, unbelievable constipation occurred. The most bizarre thing is that over these last two weeks when I’ve barely eaten enough to keep a bird alive I have not lost a single ounce…not one!! It makes no sense. After the misery of several days at 2.4 I backed off to 1.8 but still was horribly nauseated. I’m now trying again at 1.2 just to see if I can tolerate it at that level. With my out of pocket being over $1,400.00 for this first 45 days and the negative side effects, I won’t refill. I will say however, my sugar cravings are non-existent. I don’t know if it’s because I’m already so sick to my stomach that I can’t tolerate anything, including chocolate which is one of my downfalls, or if the drug would have removed those cravings anyway had I not been nauseated. Disappointed over cost and side effects."

Liraglutide,Saxenda,3/3/2022,"Barb, Ontario",55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I'm a 59 year old female, 5'5"" tall, and I was 267 lbs when I started my weight loss journey. I have been overweight since my mid-teens. I have also managed to lose weight several times in the past but not in a controlled or healthy way (up to 40 lbs). I've never been able to keep it off and usually end up rebounding higher than when I started. I started on Saxenda early November of 2021. I am currently down just over 50 lbs. I do not have a defined goal weight, I am just aiming for 5 lbs at a time. I have stopped maintaining my diet twice now during the overall time frame, but I did not stop the Saxenda shots (and only gained back about 2-3 lbs each time). I am only at the 1.8 dose and may not need to go any higher and I just went up to that about 2 weeks ago, when I realized I had plateaued for about 3 weeks. I started on Saxenda after consultations with my family doctor who referred me to a weight loss management doctor. I have been able to reduce blood pressure meds once so far and I'm hoping for another reduction shortly. I have NEVER felt as good as I do right now. I am on a low carb diet and only eat between an 8 hour window each day. I have had no side effects (except some very occasional upper stomach pain). I used to be bloated all the time before (and gassy), I am never bloated or gassy any more. I sometimes get leg cramps at night (but I know that's because I didn't drink enough - not because of the Saxenda). My doctor told me to take Magnesium Bisglycinate because I was having constipation. I added one 200 mg capsule daily until the issue resolved (she said I could take up to 7 daily if needed, but I settled at 4). I have a pretty sedentary job and work from home, so I haven't added in a lot of exercise. I feel like my concentration is better, my appetite is under control (for the first time ever), I'm sleeping really well, and overall I have no complaints. However, as I mentioned, my big concern was would I gain everything back again once I reach a weight I'm happy with. My doctor said that I will likely need to stay on Saxenda for up to 2 years, once I finish losing weight. She said my body is going to want to put the weight back on again and it can take up to 2 years for my brain to completely reset to my new weight. She also said I'll have to keep weighing myself regularly, and if I notice 3-5 lbs of regained weight, I'll simply go on the reduced carb diet again for a week or two. I am encouraged not just by my great weight loss so far (50 lbs in 4 months with 3 weeks not dieting), but also by a plan to help ensure I never regain this weight again. Thank you Saxenda! Thank you to my doctors!"

The treatment is supposed to help you choose the fruit over the chocolate, not make you stop eating. if you stop eating, as many do, after a while you hunger hormones in your body will reach a level where the effects of the treatment won't be able to overcome your body need for nutrients and the instinct so seek food for survival. Also your metabolic rate will slow down and you will burn less calories. the medicine doesn't stop working its just your body having had enough of you not feeding it and releasing large quantities of hunger hormones. so make sure you take advantage of the treatment and start making the right choices, the treatment should help with that, while having an appropriate amount of protein, nutrients and calories in your diet. if in doubts take your ideal weight in pounds and multiply by 12. that's the amount of calories you should be aiming for and not a ridiculous low amount of calories that is just not sustainable and your body just won't allow you to carry on. your body has its own mechanisms from stopping you doing that and that is how it supposed to be. if you dropped a large amount of weight in a small period of time be ready for it, the hunger will follow, make no mistake"

For the first few months, the side effects - gas bloat, nausea, and vomiting - were pretty bad, but itâ??s definitely a good reminder to eat better foods and to watch my portions.

I do try to take advantage of this and fast for one day a week. I am able to eat more tho, even get slightly hungry, but still able to control how much i eat. Which is basically once or twice a day and not more than a handful of food each time. You must limit how much you eat if you want to lose wt!! Im at 2.4 dose and have not yet taken the 3.0. i actually stayed at the dosage until i felt good enough to up the dose. which is not how the instructions say but as you know, it can make you feel pretty sick. I am hoping to start loosing wt again, more at a consistent rate. Will probably start some wt training to see if it helps lose more wt. Maybe my body lost too much too quick and needs to catch up?? who knows?  If this happened to you, what did you do to restart losing wt??

Liraglutide,Saxenda,8/22/2019,OldMom,45-54,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,4,4,4,4,6,2,"As of this writing, I've been on Saxenda for 10 months. I worked up to full dosage as directed. Symptoms were a little nausea at first, but it went away within a month or two. It worked great at first, I wasn't hungry in the least and would forget to eat. I've lost 25 pounds but the last few weeks have gained back 3. The loss was slow. I feel at this point my body is used to Saxenda. I've discovered I eat b/c I'm bored or just because I think it's time (like lunch at noon, etc) not because I'm actually hungry. I think it's still helping with hunger some, but because I keep eating when I'm not hungry I'm gaining some back. This has me very concerned as to whether or not I'll be able to keep the weight off. My insurance has me pay $30/month and with the rebate card you get from drug maker they take $5 off so my monthly cost is $25 at Walmart. I believe my insurance will only pay for 1 year, so I'm on a time limit. I find I'm feeling bad about myself for eating when I'm not hungry. My old eating habits have crept back in, snacking on candy/chocolate/ice cream and larger than needed portions and I'm sure that's to blame for the weight gain. I might mention I'm female with life long weight issues of being 20-40 pounds overweight most of my adult life. I'm 49, I work from home, am sedentary and I'm now entering menopause (yay me - not- the hot flashes suck!) Another side note however I'm not sure it's directly related to Saxenda is that my blood pressure went through the roof after being on it for 5 months. I couldn't find any info that said that was a symptom. But after losing the initial 20 pounds I'm now on BP meds. My Dr. says she thinks it's birth control pill related combine with my age. I'm off BC and still on BP meds. I am curious to know if anyone else had issues with BP with this drug. I've never had BP issues until now. Maybe it's just time? Hopefully this helps future users."

So many people say they loose their appetite and have to force themselves to eat, still waiting for this ""full feeling"".  Could it be that I am a vegan and already eat low fat and few calories, thats why I have no symptoms?  I am the enigma that no one can figure out, I count calories1000 - 1400 cal/day, eat whole foods, never fast food and my blood work looks good.  I look at food and gain weight.  I am the only "" healthy fat vegan"".  I really need this to work, I can only hope that I will progress and lose weight as I increase my dose. FINGERS CROSSED"

I told my dr. about it but all should could say is reduce the dosage and drink plenty of fluids.  I did and I didn't get better until I took the dosage back to 1.2. I was also concerned with the size affects that was of this drug.  Thyroid cancer and heart problems and stomach problems. I am gradually weaning myself off this drug.I haven't lost weight for3 months so to me I don't need to be on something that cost and to be honest I have to do this on my own anyway.  All the medicine does is curve the appetite. It's not worth me having thyroid cancer or other side affects down the road.

My only hope is I keep it off. Exercise for me is minimal because of my sciatica so I manage my meals and stay hydrated. I worry if I stop the injections the weight will return

Immediately began having headaches and extreme exhaustion.  Very sad - don't know how I'm going to get past this point.  First few weeks lost 14 pounds.  Now not losing and maybe it's because I can't increase without side-affects.   Not everyone reacts the same.  I will say that I still do not have the cravings for sugar that I had prior to beginning the program.  So that's good news.  I ride a recumbent bike and lift light weights about 4-6 times a week.  Sometimes walk my dog for about 1/2 mile during the week too, but exercise is not new to me - always exercise.  I plan to attempt increase again hoping side effects go away.  Life does not allow for extreme exhaustion."

Supressed appetite for sweets, however it made me bloat up from my breast all the way down to my stomach, and I felt ill. After, rereading Saxenda drug info, I did not notice that it specifically states, not to be used as a weight loss or appetite suppressant. It is used for diabetic patient's. So, I wasted 180.00 USD( out of pocket) for 5 weeks of injections. I fault myself for not reading thoroughly and researching info properly."

My doctor recommended I take my pantoprazole twice a day rather than just in the morning to mitigate this side effect.

I am also Diabetic. I have around 20 lbs to lose but I do have concerns about gaining it back after going off the script. Has anyone had any experience with this? My dr only wants me on it for 1 month...maybe to kick me into overdrive, LOL. Good luck everyone!"

The whole needle thing for me was causing me so much anxiety at first, I was almost going to quit but after a few days it got easier. I am on 1.2mg dose right now and no side effects since upping from .06. My appetite is minimal but I track everything I eat through my fit bit and I average about 1200 calories a day. so far for me this drug is great only thing I can note for the women out there is that the meds did mess with my cycle a bit (this happened to my co-worker who is on saxenda also so its not just me) but that doesn't bother me much. Cant wait to see my progress after a few months! From my current weight, I would like to loose 51 pounds to total 60 pounds!"

However, I have been using a sample from my Dr.  Got denied 2x and on appeal from ins co because I didn't try 1 of 5 other drugs first. Has anyone  been able to get approval for this that could maybe offer any suggestions. I tried calling the company and the only program they offer for patients I am not able to benefitfrom.

Minor weight loss initially, like 5 lbs in 3 months which then crept back up to where I started. Not hard to use and not painful. Just didn't work for me. No side effects. No nausea, nothing. So no weight loss. I think when this works, it works by making you feel crummy (nausea, constipation) so no side effects, no effect. Phooey. I had been hoping..."

It really works. I have lost 20 pounds but also lost inches. I feel much better. In the beginning I could barely eat. The forth week I experienced severe diarrhea, heartburn andtirednbess, This lasted for over a month. After that the side effects ended and I feel much better. In fact, I think my body is used to it now. I feel if I exercised I would have lost more weight as well. Its worth a try. I didn't want to do the gastric sleeve."

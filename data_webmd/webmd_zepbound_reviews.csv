Have been on for 5 weeks, have only lost 3 lbs.  Not sure if due to med or just increasing exercise and watching what I eat.  Extremely tired all the time.  Usually have 1-2 days of no stool, then by day 3 have a lot of loose stool."

It does curve my appetite, sometimes too much.  I have gastrointestinal side effects.  I had a cookie yesterday and was so nauseous with severe stomach pain.  I didn't realize what was happening until I read the reviews about sugar.  I must have missed that info in the package insert.  I also have headaches, fatigue and aching.  I will probably finish my last injection and then quit.  I know it takes time before you see any real results but the side effects are abit much. This isn't really helping me."

Tirzepatide,Zepbound,2/4/2025,Lindsay A.,35-44,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I have been premenopausal for over 2 years now. I put on approximately 35lbs and have severe hot flashes. I started taking Zepbound my weight was at 184. I’m on my 3rd week and I’m down 177. I have also noticed that my hot flashes have slowed down. I’m NOT saying this meditation took them away but losing some weight has less skin to skin rubbing. IDK But I will say my appetite is reduced, and I do feel fuller sooner than before taking this medication. I do the injections in my stomach with little to no pain. It has been a great experience so far."
Tirzepatide,Zepbound,1/28/2025,Sue L.,55-64,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Weight Loss Management for Overweight Person with BMI 27 to 29 and Weight-Related Comorbidity,4.666666666666667,5,5,4,,1,"I have been on Zepbound since March of 2024. As of today I have lost 72 pounds. I have had some side effects, mostly constipation issues with this medication but for the most part that is manageable.  With the exception of a few months because of the shortage of the drug but I have increased monthly to a higher dose and have been on the highest dose, 15 mg, for a few months now.  I am now at 167 pounds so I do not know how long my doctor or insurance will allow me to take this prescription, hopefully longer to maintain my weight since it really works! I also have followed Weight Watchers on this entire journey to eat healthy and live a healthier lifestyle for my future. I highly recommend this for weight related issues."

I was not hungry, and when I did eat, I was full very quickly. When I got to 10mg, I started having projectile vomiting the early morning hours after my shot days.  After being on 10mg for 7 weeks and dealing with this same problem, I have gone back down to 7.5mg and still had Vomiting the morning after my shot. I have only been back down to 7.5mg for one dose and plan to see if the vomiting continues after my 2nd dose.  If I am still having the vomiting, I will definitely see if my doctor can prescribe me something else.  I really want to stay on Zepbound because it has helped me lose 34 stubborn pounds and I am getting really close to my goal weight. I have been on this drug since August 27, 2024."

Hang it there!  It will be worth it!"

Side effects I am experiencing are thinning hair loss, extreme fatigue the day after injection, shortness of breath. I do not drink enough water, so I occasionally get headaches. I cannot eat any kind of carbohydrate, fat or white sugars as it causes extreme nausea. Although I am experiencing side effects, my Doc is monitoring me and says I am doing well.  I no longer have back pain and my knees no longer buckle. Well, one knee does, but that is not because of obesity. I use the injection pen. It is easy and is not painful. Barely even a prick. There is no way I’d be able to use a syringe."
Tirzepatide,Zepbound,11/14/2024,Annie,55-64,Female,Patient,,Weight Loss Management for Overweight Person with BMI 27 to 29 and Weight-Related Comorbidity,5,5,5,5,1,0,In the first month  I lose 20 pounds. I was on 2.5. For the second month I’m on .5 on Tuesday I took my 3rd shot of .5 and I have a little rash around the injection site. I’m still losing weight.
Tirzepatide,Zepbound,11/14/2024,Squirrel,55-64,Female,Patient,,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,"In spite of the below side effects, it has been worth it to lose 40lbs in 4 months without exercise (I am mobility disabled).  I have far more to go but I see motivating photo results on Reddit Zepbound pages. The Pen injections don’t hurt! But the side effects have not been easy.  1. At starting dose 2.5 mg, came diarrhea for about a month. If I ate anything oily or with corn fructose, my stomach revolted.  It modified my food behavior!  2. If I overeat, I feel nauseous and sometimes get headaches.  3.  After I went to 5mg at month 3, I was very constipated - like for 3-7 days.  I found a non-medical solution: cup of strong coffee with 3-4 spoons real sugar & fat & sugar free creamer, then 6-8 oz of prune juice.  Wait 2-3  hours, and if no results, drink a 2nd cup of prune juice.  Wait up to another 3-4 hours. Patience is a virtue!  I’ve seen miracle weight losses on Reddit but if you don’t change your behavior with food, you will be one of the 95% who gain it back after stopping."

I have no appetite and if I eat I feel sick. I will not be continuing this medication."
Tirzepatide,Zepbound,11/3/2024,Lesie,55-64,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I started this medication in Jan 2024. It's now November 2024.  I have lost 100 LB's  It has been a game changer for me.  I don't have sleep apnea anymore, My blood pressure has gotten better. I', feeling so much better no more being short of breathe. But.......I have suffered the side effects, burping, nausea, Injection site itching. But I noticed if you give yourself the injection in your thigh the side effects are not so bad.  and I found also, if you do the injection in the fatty part of your thighs meaning the inside if your thigh, you don't suffer the side effects.  I had to pay out of pocket of $550 a month because my insurance would not pay for it. Which is a shame. But I do know people who their insurance did cover the cost.

It seems Zepbound is better than Ozempic, people who I know who has used Ozempic had to come off it and go to the ER due to the side effects. 

But if you use Zepbound and had the experience I had. you will be extremely Happy."

Tirzepatide,Zepbound,8/27/2024,SATXpatient,45-54,Male,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Weight Loss Management for Overweight Person with BMI 27 to 29 and Weight-Related Comorbidity,5,5,5,5,1,0,"When blood work came back during my annual physical earlier this year (2024), my steadily increasing A1C levels had finally crossed over into pre-diabetic. My cholesterol was increasing as well. My blood pressure averaged 145/93, and I was on two medications for that.

My doctor asked if I had thought about the new weight loss drugs Zepbound and Wegovy. He said that both drugs had just received FDA approval for weight loss, that both drugs were remarked/dosed versions of existing drugs to treatdiabetes, and that likely insurance would fight to cover them. He suggested Zepbound as he felt it was the better medication, and sure enough, insurance denied it. I got the cash discount from the manufacturer and had two months in savings I could spare, so I paid for the first two months out of pocket. I have never had any side effects to speak of. This was a life-changing medication. I can't state that in any other way. 

After the first month, I had lost almost 20 pounds. My cravings were no longer an issue (and they still aren't). After the second month, I lost another 20 pounds. I could return to the gym and exercise - my body no longer hurt just moving around. My doctor took me off one of my blood pressure meds as my typical blood pressure was now at 108/63. Even my plague psoriasis cleared up (this is NOT a known condition Zepbound treats, but after ten years with psoriasis, it's gone). My insurance finally covered Wegovy, which I have been on since, with a total weight loss now of 56 pounds. My A1C level is back to normal, my blood pressure continues to stabilize in the 116/69 zone, I'm off my psoriasis medication and one of my blood pressure meds. My cholesterol is back to normal. I am eating significantly better than I have in decades. I am consistently working out. Again, this medication is a life changer."
Tirzepatide,Zepbound,2/23/2024,Tolman,65-74,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,Works very well for me to control appetite. Few side effects. A real life changer for me.

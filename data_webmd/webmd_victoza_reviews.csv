However, from the first dose I had trouble sleeping more than 4 hours a night and my personality underwent a major change.  Belching was a major problem as well so after a month the doctor switched me to the 1.2 dose which helped with the gas but still not sleeping well. Before Victoza I was eating healthy and exercising 30-60 minutes a day, twoweeks in I had to quit exercising because I didn't have the energy and my diet became 75% junk food.

I quit taking it because I wanted to enjoy the taste of food again.  Since quitting it, food again tastes OK.  I suspected that people lost weight because they experienced the same thing.

Liraglutide,Victoza,4/7/2016,MarieQC,35-44,Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Other,5,5,5,5,3,0,"I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (POS) years ago. Last year, I was referred to a doctor that specializes in this disease; at the time I first met him, I weighed a whopping 387 pounds (I’m 5’10’’). Of course, the first thing he told me was that my POS would get better if I lost weight. I was totally discouraged! I told him that I was very active and had been on EVERY diet… nothing seemed to work. I was so frustrated and asked if there was anything he could do to jump start my weight loss from a medical stand point. This is when he told me about Victoza and about the study that demonstrated that individuals suffering from POS, not from Type 2 diabetes had lost weight on this medication but there were some serious side effects to consider. I was so desperate that after reading on the matter for a few days, I decided to try it out. The first months were pretty horrible because I had severe nausea and vomiting (in the morning upon waking I would throw up stomach acid – I know erk!) but I decided to continue. The reason I kept up with it is that, for the first time in my life, I could sense that I was full when I ate. For some reason, this message was not making its way up to my brain when I ate before… I thought it was awesome. The medication no only killed every craving I normally had but it stopped me from overeating. I have been on Victoza for one year now. The side effects are no longer there (they stopped after about 6 months after starting Victoza) and I now weigh 276 pounds… yes I lost over 100 pounds. I am continuing to lose weight and wish you all the best."

The heartburn, nausea, great scott. I will say however that it did bring my blood sugar down very fast and kept it at 100. Needle was very small.

I tried Bydereon, once a week exenatide, but the needle was enormous and worse it left a lump at the injection site.  But it also contained my am reading to 140-160.

Only side effects were some minor nausea, and a couple days of diarrhea,but both passed after a week or so. The sugar control remains good (averaging about 110) but unfortunately the weight loss stopped. The dosages for my oral medications have dropped, and some may be eliminated. My medicare advantage plan only provides partial coverage (tier II drug)but the drug is worth it. Of course, I hope I never develop the more serious long-term side effects, but the long-term side effects of uncontrolled diabetes are pretty bad also."

I heard some great things about victoza and some really bad things so I decided to try it out and hope for the best. Sad to say that I simply couldn't stand all the side effects that I encountered while on it. I felt like I was in a daze all the time and the nausea was really bad. I completely lost my appetite and after a week I started to throw up multiple times a day. I decided to stop because it simply made me sick to my stomach. I did some research on the internet to try and find something over the counter without side effects. I found this supplement called cinnalife which so far has been amazing for me. My A1C has significantly dropped which i'm sure is a large part due to the energy that this supplement gives me. I have been very active since I started taking them. Anyways, just wanted to share that there are always alternatives to these injectables with these horrible side effects. I have heard that there are some new injectables out in the market, but I'm simply too scared to try them =("

I have had some intermittent nausea but it's mild and tolerable. Only other side offect was a mild headache and my fasting blood sugar was 77 this morning.  77!  I am also on Invokana and Glipizide and without the Victoza my sugars were in the 180s-200s fasting.  Also, for those dreading the needle, it is tiny.  I felt only one of the three needle sticks so far and the one I did feel was much less painful than sticking my finger to check my blood sugar, which I do multiple times a day.  Don't let fear of an injection keep you from considering this medication as an option.  I will update once I have been on Victoza for a longer time."
Liraglutide,Victoza,6/1/2015,judyjean,65-74,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,3,4,4,1,12,1,I took Victoza for almost as year and went to my dr. because I was having breathing problems.  He couldn't find a reason.  Then I got extreme diarrhea a couple of months later. I stopped the Victoza for a week to see if that was the problem.  It was and I also noticed my breathing got better.  I went back on Victoza and both the diarrhea and breathing problems came back so I can no longer take it.  I would become out of breath just walking from the parking lot into a store.  I was also tired a lot as I was not getting enough oxygen.  Now my energy level has also gotten better.  I was really disappointed as my A1c was lowered while I was takeing Victoza.

I had an upset stomach when first prescribed but that only lasted a couple of weeks.  In 5 months I have lowered my A1C from 7.0 to 5.8.  I have lost 16 lbs.  I have more energy and feel great.  I take with 2x/day Metformin. I exercise daily and eat a reasonably healthy diet.

I felt really good on this, did not effect my energy level. The only bad issue I had was that it increased my pulse rate too high so I had to stop using it. Wish I could have kept using it best medication I have been put on that actually worked for me without side multiple side effects."

I took the wrong dose for 4 weeks taking 3 times per day even during the ramp up. Was told to go to once per day and the med will last longer without refills. My numbers are now 85 to 97 fasted and jump to 127 after meals. I have also lost some weight due to less appetite. It will be interesting to see if the proper dose 1.8 once a day will still keep my numbers in check."

Liraglutide,Victoza,6/12/2014,David,55-64,Male,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2,4,1,1,6,0,"The Victoza did help decrease my blood sugar numbers nadmy A1C, but I had a massive amount of side effects that I didn't know was being increased by the Victoza because the Victoza was started around the same time that I was also having gallbladder issues, and had a gall stone. After my gallbladder removal I remained sick with the same symptoms I had prior to it of: heartburn, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, severe foul smelling belching, and gas. This continued for some time, and my doctor decided to remove me off my Victoza because my diabetes #'s, and A1C were getting to a level of satisfaction for her.     I remained off my Victoza for about a month, and my blood sugar numbers began to gradually creep up again, so my doctor decided to put me back on it.     I had finally became free of the side effects listed above, but still not relating them to the Victoza.  Then my wife, who is a RN said the she was getting ready to give me a Victoza injection, and wanted me to let her know if any of the symptoms that I'd had for so long returned.  Within 30 mins of receiving the Victoza injection I again started having foul smelling belching, gas, and began vomiting profusely.      Victoza is an awesome drug, and does what it's suppose to do.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is able to take it, but if you have anything weird start happening within your body once you start taking it, you can bet money that the Victoza Will be what's causing it."

That doesn't even include hives that didn't send me to the ER.  So everyday feeling not great, the last trip to the ER was in a ambulance because the reaction caused me to pass out. I lost a little weight, but when you are always nausea and diarrhea andvomiting, of course you will loose weight. I feel like I was a guinia pig with this drug.

The third week I started getting heartburn which continued into the 4th week.  I'm waiting to see the doctor to see if this is a typical side effect and how long it lasts.

I am also taking insulin.  However, my nausea turned quickly to vomiting and dizziness.  I continued in the hope these symptoms would go away.  I was certainly losing weight but at great cost.  Finally, I was so weak I had to be rushed to the emergency room.  I was severely dehydrated and my blood pressure was so low the doctor there put me on intravenous fluids. AS soon as I stopped the Victoza I began to feel better and am now feeling pretty ok.  Dizziness, dehydration and extreme low blood pressure went away. Just as well, because right before all this, I had gone to the drug store to fill my prescription for Victoza (till then my doctor had given me samples) and I found out it was going to cost $600 to fill!  Needless to say, I can´t afford this.  I live on social security and a small pension."

The nausea went away in a few weeks. I took the shot in the evening so wasn't nauseous all day, just in the morning. Needles are so small they hardly hurt at all. It decreased my appetite & I was able to lose 20 lbs. Still plagued with the diareha, but don't know if that is the victoza or the gallbladder surgery I had in July. My A1C went from 8.6 to 6.5.

The first week was at 0.6 and after that 1.2. The first day, I experienced slight nausea and a little back pain but it quickly subsided after a day. When I made the Jump to 1.2, no nausea but a slight bit of back pain again. After a day at 1.2, all was fine. Very quickly, my BG wne from 205 down to 150, and now at 135 and still going down, I also take the generic Actos as well as a Metformin. The Actos is in the AM and at the smallest dose. Three 500mg Metformin (1 in the morning-2 at bedtime) complete the regiment. Victoza, for me has been simple and painless. It's been effective and time will tell if there are adverse effects. I can only recommend that you see a really good endocrinologist. Get ALL your blood levels, A1C checked, and follow a better diet. I'm really bad about this but, I'm trying hard to be better. Also, stay away from all sodas, and drink V8 juice in moderation. Use Tabasco to give it some zing. Love yourself and life too!"

But I can speak for the last two weeks and call them a big whopping success!! Yes, there is belching and nausea, it has faded. I have diarrhea, it has not faded. The  so worth it part: blood sugars are down from 405 to 157....in TWO weeks! I do not know about weight loss amounts..haven't weighed yet. Certainly feel thinner and my pants feel looser. Prior to this drug, I wason Januvia, novolog, and metformin. Kept only the metformin (1000mg 2x day) and added this Victoza. I know this isn't the perfect drug with the side effects, but it is an answer for me.    Major tip: eat small...and I mean small...meals throughout the day. Drink slowly in between the meals. The only time I have vomited was on the second day when I ate a bowl of soup and then drank three cups of tea right away....I won't do that again!!  And don't even attempt a six inch subway sub in one sitting. I won't do that again either. I swear this drug is like a lap-band you inject! :))))"

Nice not to have to take but once a day.  Taking 1000 Metformin twice a day as well.  Lost 10 pounds after starting Victoza, just as I did for Byetta (but lost 30 then).  Took Victoza for 13 months. Quit because my husband and friends said my mouth smelled like a sewer; I had thought it was just me tasting it, but they could smell it as well.  I was belching a lot, flatulence as well.  But that taste was what drove me back to Byetta.Weight loss stops pretty fast; I think it is a side effect of the nausea making you not eat, not the drug doing something swell.  Lots of itching in the last 6 months of taking it.  Didn't change my morning blood sugar levels any better than Byetta or just Metformin, which were 120 and doc wanted below 100.  Turns out morning high due to predawn low while sleeping, causing the sugar to swing high.  This is a known phenomena; if it's just your morning sugars high, consider that. Victoza good for 3-4 months, then just like other meds.  Expensive.  Insurance company gave me hell continually about finding an alternative. Beware the sewer mouth. (I guess things were staying in the stomach so long, they were beginning to rot.)  Have your friends/spouse check your breath."

Tried all sorts of medications and this one has been the easiest and best so far.  Concerned about the thyroid cancer, but will be vigilant.  Did not like needles, but I do it on the side of my stomach and can not even feel it, unlike the finger testing.  I have also recently lost my gall bladder and have developed a candida yeast infection which has also messed up my stomach.  I was on massive amounts of anti biotics and am not sure if victoza played a role in that or not.  Trying to get my stomach balanced.  Have lost 25 pounds, but that was as much contributed to almost dying from the gall bladder and not being able to eat for two months.  Blood sugars and A1c have been GREAT since starting this.  I also take metformin (1000mg's) twice a day.  Have had to go on and off metformin due to some of the testing and the surgeries I have had, which seems to increase numbers.  Together, victoza and metformin seem to work very, very well even without major improvements in my diet.  Dont give up on the victoza/metformin.  Try tweaking things a bit until you feel better.

I have now gained back the 40 pounds plus 10 more!   I'm very disappointed.   My doctor doesn't have an explanation.    I did notice that one time when I accidently double dosed myself (several hours apart) that the appetite control came back, at least for a few hours.    I just don't see a lot of difference between taking two 1000mg of Glumetza, and taking the Glumetza plus the Victoza.    This is all based on my personal experience.

I would inject it every morning at 6:00 A.M. ant take my hypertension meds (by mouth with food) at the same time.  As I titrated the dose up to 1.8mg.'s my blood pressure began going up.  By time I reached the 1.8 mg. dose my BP had reached a really dangerous level (174/108 so I stopped taking it and my BP dropped back to it's normal(118/76) or reasonably there about.  Needless to say, my physician wasn't happy that I had discontinued theVictoza with out consulting him.  He went as far as to say ""the Victoza wouldn't do that""(time for a new Doc.) referring to the elevated BP.  Long story short..the doc. changed my BP meds and placed me back on the Victoza...Same problem with the BP again.  Not wanting to stop the Victoza because it was really controlling my blood sugar readings and food cravings, I did some more research decided to try taking the Victoza 3 hours after my BP meds....Bingo..BP has stayed within my normal range and the Victoza is working well.  My guess is that the Victoza works so well at slowing stomach emptying that the my BP meds were probably only trickling into my system if they were being absorbed at all.  Only other problem was some constipation...that seems to have passed (sorry for the bad pun)."

I recently found that not only had I gained weight but my insulin use increased substantially (daily fast acting up to 70 units; evening insulin up at 62 units).  I began using Victoza about 1 month ago and the results have been startling.  There was a 2 1/2 day period that other than the Victoza shot, I took NO insulin whatsoever!  While using VictozaI soon learned that any corrective fast acting insulin must be reduced dramatically or there are severe ""going low"" consequences.  No problem now with adjustments I've made (I take no more than 7 units of fast acting insulin for a full  day and I reduced my evening type dose to 42 units.)  Now when I awake in the morning, my blood sugars are between 80-133 and are relatively normal throughout the day.  A huge change for me.  I have also lost 15 lbs. and have a suppressed appetite (something that goes along with the Victoza use).  The side effect for me is nausea.  This side effect began on day 1 and continued for almost 20 hours/day for a month.  Now my nausea has been significantly reduced but my appetite remains suppressed.  This is a miracle drug!  My doctor says this drug contains a certain hormone (nomally produced by the body) that directs the pancreas to produce more insulin (the stated purpose of Victoza). Apparently, I have not been making this hormone for some time.  Now, 1 Victoza shot of 1.2 units/day is all it takes and I'm close to normal. I hope this all continues."

Dr. added Glucotrol, and upped the Metformin dose, and I did my best with diet and exercise, but my numbers just went up and up.  Finally went to see an endocrinologist who put me on Victoza.  Have had no noticeable side effects, and my fasting blood glucose went from 276 to 92 in a month.  A1c is down 1.5 points in that same time period.  My BG numbers are now always well withinthe normal range and I'm losing weight.  Don't love the injections, but it's not hard or painful, and the result is totally worth it!"

Minor nausea for first week but that's all. All readings have come way down, no more pain, no more swelling in legs/feet. But best news is 45 lb. weight loss. Increased from lowest to highest setting in 1 week. Not hungry, no more ""grazing"" which is my downfall normally, happy and hopeful for first time in LONG time. Only trouble is I can't afford the drug as my insurance won't cover it. Dr. has stopped giving me samples. I'm out of Victoza and now devastated. Talk about ""dangling the carrot!""

Then, was fine till a week later when I took my Vicodin again.  Also sick.  I blamed it on the Victoza, but I think it's the combo.  My numbers are incredible.  Went from morning fasting of around 250 to about 140 on the .06 dose.  Am still taking metformin and glymiperide.

I will be increasing the dose to 1.2 mg within the next week, and remain optimistic that I can deal with any side effects that might accompany the increased dose.  Victoza has been an eye opener for me.  2 or 3 days of use showed me that being more and more restrictive in my diet was not going to help my oral meds lower my blood sugar.

I am so happy with the weight lost. I started out on lowest dose, I am on max dose now. I did have nausea mostly at night and some acid reflux. It seems to be getting alot better. My glucose readings are way down. The lowest it's been in 13 years.I can't wait to go back to dr at the end of month to see what my A1C is now. Last one was 7.3.... I take Janumet 50/1000mg 2xday. Amaryl 4mg-- 1and half tab daily.Victoza 1.8mgin morning. It definitely decreased my appetite, I no longer crave sweets like I used to, which is amazing in itself.....This is a wonder drug for me, I just hope I dont end up with the thyroid cancer. My pharmacist said it is safe, that the benefits outweigh the risk and that everything has potential for serious side effects. I dont know if losing the weight has anything to do with this but I noticed my blood pressure has been really low so I decreased my benicar to see if that's what I needed... I hopefully will loose some more weight at least 20lbs and I would be so happy...... I will post my blood results when I get them next."

Also been having itching scalp, legs , arms and body but thought it was just dry skin.  Didn't know it was a side effect until today.

Using  Actos pills, Lantus at 45 units daily and Humalog 10 – 15 units 3X daily. A1C was 6.5 and gaining one pound per month.  Initial goal was to lose weight. First attempt 0.6 for one week then 1.2. Stopped because of the vomiting and hiccups.  Second attempt 0.6 for one month then 1.2. At 1.2 suffered from heartburn, ED and hiccups. Third attempt 0.6 until sugar levels begin to rise (2 Months) then went to 1.2 for two weeks. At full dose for just over a weeknow. No longer taking Lantus or Humalog with morning readings between 100 and 106. Spikes are below 180 two hours after meals and 100 – 106 before meals.  Side effects are hiccups after meals and random hiccups between meals, constipation and ED. ED medications ineffective so far.  Giving it another month to see if the ED goes away. The key was staying at a lower dose until blood sugars rose to the point of increasing insulin. Eating several small meals daily and drinking lots of water with mild exercise is a plus."

Started off at 0.6 for 1 week... then increased by two CLICKs each day for 5 days until I reached the goal of 1.2mg. I found that the slow titration upward decreased the side effects. I must say I've had some nausea the first week... but haven't vomited until today. Vomited several times this morning... not sure why now?? Injections in my stomach and thigh often times causes a quarter size bruise. I don't like that at all. I have found a hip injection to work the best... no pain or bruising. I hope that site is ok. It seems to be working pretty well. BSs are down a good bit but my fasting bs is higher than I would like... about 115 each morning. I hope my A1C gets back below 7 and I don't have to increase my dose up to 1.8. Constipation is my biggest side effect. I have never had that issue before. I'm taking 3 Docusate Sod 100mg per day.

I have nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarhea.  I thought that by changing the time I take my Victoza, 1.2, to the afternoon and my other dia., blood pressure, synthroid, etc. meds in the morning that the nausea might stop.  It hasn't.  I cannot stand the morning nausea feeling anymore. occasionally this is accompanied by vomiting/dry heaves of thick clear foamy liquid.  Victoza has decreased my appetite. I do not know how much if any weight loss yet.It has lowered by morning sugars to the 90's.  I would like to continue to take it for its appetite depressant and lower blood sugars but I cannot stand the nausea ruining days out of my life.  I have changed the timing of the medication, which seemed to help for a while, but I am still getting the nausea.  I do crave sweets more though.  I would only hope that there is a solution to my problem because I do want to continue this medication for its sugar lowering and weight loss effects but will not be able to do so with this nausea.  I have also recently had an allergic reaction requiring the immediate use of benedryl.  Don't know for sure if reaction was to the VICTOZA.

My normal after meal number is usually around 110 (2 hours after meal).  if I check again in 1 more hour, it is usually in the low 80's.  Hoping a tweak of my lantus helps out."

No appetite, so I lost weight. Now,fourth month on the drug and my appetite is back, my numbers are back up,no more nausea, and weight is returning.  I think it loses its effect on the body.  I am on the maximum dose.  Symlin had the same history with me and I could not tolerate byetta at the maximum dose.  Unfortunately, I am still constipated.  The cost is excessive.  I doubt I will stay on it after the next Dr. visit."

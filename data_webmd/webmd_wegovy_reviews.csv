The first week I lost most interest in all foods. Week two experienced some nausea. End of week 3-6 I am throwing up daily, bad diarrhea, and no desire to eat. The weight is falling off because I can't keep anything down. The constipation adds to the nausea. The weight is coming off and my sleep has improved. But is it worth it?? Will the bad symptoms go away eventually??"

I lost 25lbs on .25 wegovy dose between February 25th and May7th(about 10 weeks). I went from 178lbs to 153lbs. I am a male, 5'6"". I was already exercising for 45-50 minutes a day for 6 days a week, but I could not loose the weight. Wegovy helped me control my appetite mentally resulting in fewer calory intake and boom, the weight started to came off. I also have fatty liver disease and have recently seen some studies showing promising results with this drug. I sometimes have mild bloating and stomach cramps, but not extreme."

Nausea, indigestion, sweats and slower bowel movements. Weight loss started to ramp up after week 2 on the 1mg dose. I have lost 7kgs in 4.5 months. Have just started the 1.7mg dose and excited to see the results. This has definitely helped me after trying everything before even considering medication. I am active and on my feet every day but could not get my cravings, hunger and calories intake down after having my 3rd child.  My opinion is that it is worth the moderate side effects that come and go. I feel happy within myself again and am so much more motivated. I have also been advised that overtime they will subside. Fingers crossed!"

I have not been able to shift my weight due to not being able to move without pain. Prior to taking it I had just tried the svelte diet plan and had actually lost 2kg in the 11 days detox. I decided to keep following the food suggestions within this diet plan whilst taking wegovy.

I kept losing weight by small amounts whilst taking 0.25 and 0.5 amounts. I had a small amount of nausea and tiredness but that wasonly in the first two days of taking the injection. I've just completed my 4th injection of 1.0 and at this dosage the weight has been falling off. I have been waking up in the night with indigestion but have found sleeping on my left side eases this.  

I am no longer waking up and walking in pain, im no longer limping and feeling so much lighter. My belly has gone and i can see down there again. I've lost 12kg so far and am so thankful for wegovy in helping me shift this weight off.

The only complaint i have is the shock of finding out as the dosages go up the price goes up by a ridiculous amount! I'm in Australia and the doses from 0.25 to 1.0 were $260 per month. I filled my first script for 1.7 it has gone up to $380!!

I will be speaking with my doctor to let her know she needs to inform her patients that the costs increase with the dosages."

The first week wasn’t so bad , my cravings for food decreased and I felt full faster. Nausea was on and off , would creep up on random hrs of the day. I have loss 10lbs in 2 weeks but it is because I cut down on sugar and been limiting my carb intake. Today I over ate and feel like crap. The burps are no joke . The heaviness and fullness feels. But uncomfortable. Headache and dizziness is a bit challenging to deal with at the moment . Despite the side effects I hope they subside because I feel some of my inflammation has gone down which has helped me into being able to stay active thru my day. I just hope the dizziness does go away because it’s a bit hard to even walk straight without thinking I’m gonna fall. Almost fells like I’m drunk ? I don’t know of anyone has this feeling to the med. will see how it goes. So far it’s been working but the side effects will determine if it’s gonna work for me in the long run"

While I lost 4lbs the 1st week I wish I had read some of these reviews before taking the 2nd shot because I have been in SEVERE PAIN since injecting the 1st one!!
I have suffered from chronic back pain for years so at first I did not think much of it accept that the severity of my pain was way too high with no discernable cause AND my blood felt like and still feels like it is literally on fire causing my entire body to be in extreme pain if I don't take more of my prescribed pain meds than normally needed for my normal amount of back pain!!  I did some research on this drug when the pharmacist warned me about this drug when I picked it up and I decided not to take it.

It tells me when I've had enough by making me feel repulsed but only when I've reached  my limit, which is a lot less than I thought it would be.  It also has taught me not to eat at bedtime or I will get stomach pains and have sulphur burps.  This all sounds horrible but it's the kick in the butt that I needed to teach me that I don't need so much food.  Had ice cream the other day, my all time favourite food, had about 4 bites and i was fine with that and gave the restaway.  Not because I was trying to have will power but because I genuinely just didn't want it.  The key is to make sure you eat something small if you forget to eat or you will feel sick, don't eat before bed and stop fretting about calories, just make healthy decisions, supplement with protein shakes if you really can't eat."

Minus the terrible migraines (which are easily solved by a BC), low sex drive, mood swings, and expensive price…. I still love it! I weighed 225 when I first started (5 months ago) and I currently weigh 135 which was my pre FIVE kiddos weight!!!!! I am able to fit into some pants I still had from my high school days (18 years ago) It’s amazing! I bought weights and exercise tools from 5 Below and downloaded a couple light workout apps. I also work at Sonic and deliver 200 or more orders a day so that may have what helped me a little too. I started eating yogurt, nuts, and straight protein and drinking a ton of water a day! On average I would lose 7-12 pounds in a month which does lead to saggy skin (not much) but hey it does work. However, weening off I feel awful…. Yes, it’s expensive but it IS worth it! You’ll get a tonnnnnnn of compliments when you start dropping weight too! ??"

Semaglutide,Wegovy,10/6/2024,Anonymous,65-74,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,"This medication works.  I've gone from 184lbs to 155lbs in 19 weeks.  I'm pre-diabetic.  Dieting and exercise never worked for me.  I was miserable in my own skin.  I couldn't lose weight - even after months on a 1000-calorie /day diet. 

My side effects are minimal (occasional nausea) now.  I did have a lot of nausea to start with - but 'morning sickness' home remedies worked. 

The benefits are amazing!  I used to be so out of breath when I'd do anything strenuous - not any more.  I'm comfortable in my own skin again.  My BP is down!  I'm completely satisfied with small portions and have zero cravings. 

If this doesn't work for you - or if you have bad side effects - perhaps Wegovy isn't the right treatment for you.  

Perhaps the side effects are due to another medication you take?
After losing 20 lbs, I was lightheaded and dizzy.  It wasn't the Wegovy - it was because I no longer needed BP medication.      I stopped the BP med and immediately the dizziness was gone. 

I hope my review helps you!"

Three out of the four syringes did not work. Wegovy helpline would not give me voucher for replacement syringes because their policy is the prescribing physician must increase your dosage every four weeks. Since that not happen with my doctor (I have kidney disease & fibromyalgia) so he wanted me on 0.25mg for 8 weeks. As this is against company's prescribing policy, I am out of luck. Will have to pay for med myself as I know the insurance company wouldnot cover an issue with the product. Or be without medicine for 3 weeks.

About the 5th and 6th day of taking it, I cannot express the extreme body pain I had in the mornings when I wanted to get out of bed.  I had to call for one of my kids to help me and I am not even 50 yet.  It hurt to move and it was impossible to even get into some form of motion.

2 Weeks and a day past the injection of the first shot and I have like this boil where the injection site was.  It is still there and it is purplish read.  Thank goodness I never took shot #2.

This is definitely not for everyone. Be very aware that this will either help you or feel like it is killing you.  Those are the extremes I am reading in reviews.  I win the bad lottery on this one.

Have a dry mouth, and get cold, my clues to rehydrate.  Have had nausea, the worst, constipation, manageable, and lack of interest in food, have to remember to eat at least 3 times a day, small, small servings. I am hyper aware of how slow my digestivesystem is working.  Most side effects lesson with a couple of days of shots.  On the plus side, I genuinely feel better, more agile, and down 2 sizes.  My taste buds changed and I don’t like bland food any more, whereas before I wouldn’t touch anything spicy.  I do have fatigue and this can also be from the extreme heat we are experiencing.  My dr is pleased, my blood tests(kidney) are fine.  My blood pressure is lower.  My regular blood pressure is 110/70, and now it’s 90/55-60.  That was scary, turned out to be normal.  Fluids are doubly important now to keep my blood pressure up.  At the end of the day, the results for me outweigh the side effects.  I don’t know that I’ll go up to 2.4, maintenance for me might just be the 1.7.  Whatever hormone Weygovy is simulating has proven to me that I don’t have it in my DNA."

I was supposed to go to .68 13 days ago, but decided to bump up to only .60 to save money. I am getting 5+ weeks from a 3 mg vial (somehow, they put more in the vial.)  I started at 201, and quickly went to 189; then slowly to 185, and now at 182.5. After I complete 10 weeks of .60, I will bump up to the final .68.  My income will go up in 2.5 months. I paid $299 + $94 'membership fee' for 1 mg vial in month 1; then $299for a TWO mg vial + $94 fee. Now I am paying $299 + $94 fee for a WHOPPING 3 mg vial.

Even before I started compounded Wegovy, I had constant constipation. Stool softeners would only work a little bit. I switched to EXTRA strength Ex-Lax. It works, but I am addicted to it, ha ha!

I just barely qualify for the medicine. I am exactly 5' 5 1/2""  Provider rounded it down to 5'5"", and at 189 => 31% body fat. I actually used a previous provider who got me down from 201 to 189. He didn't weigh my or anything. His medicine ramp up scale was even more slow.

I was able to lose my  semi-temporary weight gain a lot more easily. I got covid 8 months ago, and ate a lot and rested on the sofa. So, the first 12 pound drop went fairly easy and fairly quickly.

Now, I've broken thru a stubborn plateau, and hope my weight loss continues.  Today 182.5; goal 155. If I have to, I can increase from .68 to 1.0 but it is expensive.  1.0 would only last me 3 weeks + a stupid $94 membership fee every mont"

I have found a few reviews that also mention joint pain so it definitely seems to be the drug.

For the first few months I got nausea and not a huge amount of weight loss (max 1lb a month). Found on 1mg I started to get joint pain and nausea increased (and I was sick a few times), it did massively reduce my enjoyment of food and some days I struggled to eat more than 600 calories (I am also doing Zoe in conjunction to make sure my diet is still good and average calories were between 1200 and 1500 per day), by week 3 of 1.7 my elbows and shoulders are so painful that I have decided not to take the final dose and not to increase. So for me, it was a lot of money with very little weight loss (I do have pcos and now in menopause FYI so wasn't expecting miracles but hoping for more than I lost). Just for info I only had 2 stone to lose so was not massively overweight."

The only negative thing for me is a headache every morning.  No idea why, that being said this is a powerful drug that does what it’s supposed to do. “Loose weight “
I was 294 before I started I’ve lost 9.5 lbs in 5 days.   With my prior health conditions it was necessary for me to take this.   I’m very glad I did.   A headache or stomach ache is a small price to pay.  Take my second shot tomorrow.  It is true I’m not hungry at all.  You do have to force yourself to eat which is less then half what I use to eat

I have had no side effects.  I check in with a doctor every 30 days for a check up online.  I follow exactly what she says: eat more protein drink water and eat.  When I am not hungry in the morning I go for a no sugar yogurt or an Atkins Plus protein shake.  I eat my heaviest meal at lunch now and very light dinner.  I drink lots of water.  If find Wegovy curbs my hunger and stops me from mindless eating.  I focus less on food.  I am finding it easierto stay on track and work on making better habits.  I also use the Wegovy website and have a free coach that chats with me every 2 weeks on my habits.  I think I am losing weight this time because I decided to get help from my doctor and the drug is helping me to pay attention to what I am putting in my mouth.  I will continue to take it till I reach my goals and maybe a little beyond that to wean myself off.  I have about 60 more lbs. to lose and feel I will reach my goal for the first time in 30 years (time I have been holding on to the extra weight).

These injections definitely have pros and cons. I have to take anti-nausea medication at least once a day to be able to tolerate any of the doses, and take it more frequently the couple days following my injection. I would not be able to get the injections without that. I never feel great or normal, but it is usually tolerable. I have definitely had a decreased appetite (which is theobvious goal) but can also be difficult, since most of the time nothing is appealing to eat and you can start to feel more sick from not eating enough. I have personally had a difficult time drinking water as it has become more unappealing as well. So I have to really push it. My acid reflux is a little worse and my stomach often feels tender. I go back and forth between constipation and diarrhea. I had a couple days of frequent sulfur burps. 
I haven't lost a lot of weight as far as the scale is concerned but have definitely gone down inches and my clothes fit more loosely. I am learning that a lot of other people have been having that same experience. That part of it can be confusing and discouraging at times, but you have to remind yourself you are actually losing weight. I think that side effect is actually somewhat common, but I don't think there are really any answers yet as to why, and that it isn't really a well known aspect outside of those of us experiencing that. Part of it may be due to constipation/fewer bowel movements, slower digestion and bloating.
While it has come with a lot of challenges for sure, I still feel it is tolerable enough for me to continue for now."

My weight has exponentially increased over time. I started Wegovy in March 2023 at 200lbs. Followed the recommended titration, slowly.  I started .25 and then stayed on .5 for two months. I lost 16 pounds in 3 months and was feeling amazing!! Yes, some acid reflux and then slight nausea on dose day but not worse than after a night out of drinking and eating greasy foods!  

Then, the ""supply issue happened"".  It was extremely difficult to locate the 1mg dose and my PCP refused to prescribe the 1.7mg. Most pharmacies I contacted didnt even want to discuss supply and I became frustrated. I tried intermittently to locate 1mg to no avail. I then gained back 8 pounds (but not the 16!). 

I FINALLY found the 1mg dose 2 weeks ago. My pcp recommended I return to .25mg due to possible GI issues but I went for it and took the 1mg as I had minimal to no side effects from the other two doses. Unfortunately, I ate a pretty big meal that evening and then took the 1mg injection. I was sooooo sick all night long, pressure on my stomach and nausea all night. And you cant 'undo' the injection once it's administered. I decided to stop fighting the nausea and vomited the next morning, which made me feel so much better. I was very nauseas for a few days and am happy to say that I am back on track with weight loss with no side effects after my injections (3 so far). Ive lost 6lbs in the past three weeks. 

Due to the lack of appetite, I am making sure my body is getting enough vitamins and minerals by taking supplements and forcing myself to eat things like oatmeal, vegetables etc.  I have a company in my town that will do my labs for a reasonable price which for me is important for holistic wellness (insurance is finicky). I am feeling great and enjoying the idea that my blood pressure and cholesterol issues may reduce as I continue my weight loss journey."

I was at my highest weight 207 lbs and my daughter had just got engaged.  I needed to do something for myself, so when my doctor recommended Ozempic, I decided to try it.  I lost small amounts of weight each week, so was feeling good, but decided I needed some structure, so that I didn't go back to my old habits.  I joined Noom and that kept me paying attention to what I was eatingand where my weight was at.  I felt nauseous and immediately full after a few bites of food, but never got sick.  I couldn't eat greasy food and if I did, I would feel very sick after eating it.  After a few months of Ozempic, I switched to Wegovy because of the shortage but still continued to feel good.  I'm so happy to say that I've lost 60 lbs and am just short of my goal of 140lbs by 5 lbs.  This medication is a miracle for those who have tried unsuccessfully to lose weight on their own.  It's a great jump start for those who have a lot of weight to lose and when you see your body working the way it should, it's very motivating!  Well worth trying!!!"

Started on 0.25mg for 4weeks. Had a few side effects with the first 2 injections of 0.25mg. Felt light headed ,some nausea and fatigue at times but was tolerable and managable with pepto bismol. Easy to inject and painless. I inject into my thigh because I read that you have less side effects. It works for me. It definitely decreased my appetite. My starting weight was 210 and now it is 196 in 6 weeks. I', glad I didn't let the negative reviews stop me from trying wegovy. I am looking forward to completing the 0.5 mg in 3 weeks with no side effects and more weight loss and hopefully move up to the next dose of 1mg. Will update at a later date."

There were a few weeks after that where I could not get the prescription filled. I then was able to get the 1.0mg dose which I took 9 days ago. I was sick, vomiting, for 2 days. The side effects subsided after that. I took my second dose of 1.0mg 2 days ago and I was violently ill on the second day, couldn’t even keep down water, and even after purging everything in my stomach, I was vomiting a ton of bile.

I started at 230 lbs. I currently weigh 175. The only downside is the nausea. If you overeat, you'll be super nauseous. Also, any time you start a new dose, it may also come with a bit of nauseousness. I've had no desire to drink alcohol which I love. I used to drink quite a bit. Not an alcoholic but I would drink during the weekend. There's absolutely no desire for it so that's good. Once you get past the first day or two of nausea, you're back to normal."

It would only last about 4 days then my appetite would pick back up. 1.7 is my sweet spot. I eat about half of what I use to eat pre-Wegovy. I workout with weights and cardio 5 days a week for an hour. I have lose 32lbs in about 7-8mths. There was times when the medicine was on backorder.

I began on the max 2.4mg dosage after trying to obtain lower doses for nearly a year to no avail.  I dropped from 260 lbs to 237 lbs in 2 weeks.  The first 3 days at this dosage was absolute hell, which I expected.  I vomited 4 or 5 different times over the first few days and felt drained and fatigued.  I could not stomach any food whatsoever during the first 3 days and just sipped on a bit of waterfrom time to time. However, after the 3rd day, I was 100% and back to normal in all ways, except my appetite.  I hardly ever feel hungry and when I eat, I can typically only eat a small portion before feeling full.  For example, 2 weeks in, I can only eat like a 3rd of a cheeseburger or a  half of a salad.  Another good by product is that I hardly drink anything alcoholic any more (beer and wine).  Just no craving for it.  When I started week 2 and took my second injection, I was expecting to have to go through hell again.  That did not happen.  Felt great and still do starting my 3rd week.  Lots of energy, no sleep issues, and losing lots of weight.  Just took my 3rd injection yesterday and feel great.  In summary, the first 3 days absolutely sucked for me, but so glad I stuck it out.  Spending a lot less on food and drinking a lot less alcoholic drinks.  Very noticeable weight loss in my face so far.  I am also told that I don't snore anymore (lol).  Hoping this pattern continues over the next couple of months.  Very happy with Wegovy!"

I was at a concert when I tried a vodka lemonaide and ate half a hot dog after not eating all day and just drinking water. 10 minutes later I had horrible abdominal pain. I chalked it up to constipation, but it got so much worse. The pain was different than anything I have ever felt. Even drinking water was killing me. It felt like I swallowed razor blades and my intestines were ripping and my upper backwas shredding into pieces. The pain lasted for 3 days with constant diahrea. I skipped this injection because the pain was worse than my gallbladder surgery. Last night the pain moved to the left upper abdominal area, it felt like I was being stabbed for hours on end. Literally my entire left upper stomach was visably twitching. The pain subsided today, im still constipated, extremly bloated, and tired as hell. Only 3 weeks in and I feel horrible.

Thats what drugs do. They give side effects to combat an ailment. Even multivitamins can cause vomiting, dehydration, gi issues and lightheadedness. If you don't use as prescribed then it is not the med to blame. If you expect to take a shot and wake up tomorrow 100lbs less you will be disappointed. 

I have had side effects but got through it. It wasn't pleasant but I got through it. I am happy to stay close to a bathroomonce a week if it means my body can be in less pain because of my weight. Getting older sucks way more when excess weight mixes with normal wear and tear. 
I do think that too many people are not realistic about what this does. It doesn't fix everything by itself and nothing is going to give you that social media glow that isn't real to begin with. Even when you do lose a lot in the end, you now have another round of new problems. You look like a deflated balloon and are dealing with the complexity of being a fat person in a stranger's skinny body. 

Moral of this story. If this works the way you think it should you didn't need it to begin with. If you quit because you don't like the side effects, you didn't need this to begin with. Some of us are desperate, including myself, and will do anything to feel less pain. No one should stay on a med they don't like but don't blame it all on the drug."
Semaglutide,Wegovy,8/3/2023,Elizabeth,25-34,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,2.6666666666666665,2,4,2,1,0,"I have been taking Wegovy since the end of April 2023. Due to supply issues, I took 2-months worth of the .25 dose and then now 2-months worth of the .5 dose. I have one more dose of the .5ml pen left, but have put off taking it due to experiencing extreme side effects last week (the 2nd time this has happened). It feels like a really bad case of the flu, mixed with nausea, vertigo, a horrible headache, fatigue, and having a very hot, flushed face that I cannot cool down no matter what I do. I can’t stand for more than a few seconds at a time either. It’s seriously awful. I have been prescribed nausea medication and will still sometimes throw up out of nowhere. Mostly like acid reflux. I noticed that this has happened a day or two after taking my 6th or 7th shot of the SAME dose. It is almost unbearable. Also, it is really scary that these side effects can appear seemingly out of nowhere when other weeks I feel mostly fine (maybe not ever 100% but manageable). I think these side effects may also be corresponding with my period, but that’s just a theory. So, adding that into the mix is the cherry on top of what is a horrible experience. 

Some weeks I feel less hungry than others, but it has never been consistent or gotten progressively “better” with each week. I already try to drink a ton of water, but have upped my water intake even more since starting the medication in hopes of helping avoid any potential side effects. I have also tried to incorporate more protein and veggies into my diet and stay away from really greasy foods or lots of sugar. Again, some days or weeks are better than others, but overall, I have made some decent improvements to my diet and still haven’t been able to lose much weight or keep off the little bit I have lost. When I’m not experiencing extreme fatigue or any other side effects, I am usually able to exercise 2-3 times a week. But if the fatigue creeps up on me? Forget about it. It will feel like I’ve been drugged.

Overall, I’m disappointed that the medication hasn’t worked the way I’ve heard it has for others. My doctor reminded me that not everyone experiences rapid weight loss in the first few months, but I guess I just assumed (or hoped) that’s what would happen. She feels that my progress is good enough/gradual and that if I can get my hands on the medication during these crazy shortages then I should try to push through. However, risking feeling like death 2-3 days every 6 weeks has me questioning if it’s worth it. I want to be the healthiest version of myself, but have never found it easy to lose weight without crash dieting. As I get older and my metabolism slows, it only becomes increasingly more difficult. I want to be heart healthy, have energy, and feel my best. So far, Wegovy has occasionally made me feel less hungry, but the anxiety and stress that comes with experiencing side effects and dealing with supply chain issues/coverage is a lot."

Headaches and the runs the first 2 days and the runs when I upped to the 1.7 dosage for about 10 days. Only other side effect was fatigue. Though when I'm fatigued that's when the weight comes off.

   Was able to eat the foods I like, though I avoided pasta, bread and sugar foods, diet mainly meat and baked potato. Wegovy curbed my carb addiction considerably, snacking reduced by about 80 percent and meals by about 40 percent.

I’m now 3 days since my last shot and I am still overwhelmingly dizzy and feel so out of control. Only thing that helps is laying in a dark room trying not to move my head at all. One slight move and the whole room is spinning all over again. Nausea and vomiting has subsided at this point now.  
Before this medication I was on Mounjaro and that one had gone MUCH better but insurance no longer covers it for people using it for weight loss.
This has been such an horrible experience and I would not recommend this medication to anyone!!"

After 14 days of feeling increasingly worse (extreme and sudden depression and crippling anxiety, weakness to the point I can barely walk across the house, fatigue, massive brain fog, confusion,  dizzy, cold and chills with no fever, rash on arms, swelling in neck, headache, eye pain, blurry vision,  jacked up blood pressure) I went to the ER. All sorts of abnormal labs for kidney function, electrolytes, metaboloc acidosis and messed up red blood counts. Prior to that dose, I was doing great, exercising daily, sticking to my lifestyle changes and happy with the results. Now I'm weak and unable to exercise, work, concentrate, feeling unmotivated, tired, moody, and anxious. It feels like I'm literally dying and there's nothing that helps. It's everything I can do to force myself to eat and drink a little bit.  This med doesn't help that much to justify feeling like absolute hell, mentally and physically for weeks after stopping it. I see that many people experience the same gigantic kick in the face at the 1.0 to 1.7 mg dose . I wish there was an antidote, I would pay anything to end this torture. I'll do this my dang self once I can muster the strength to move, think clearly, and get out of this quick, hard hitting depression.  Sorry brain, sorry kidneys, bye-bye sanity."

I have lost 15 pounds, so I will say it is very effective. I am currently at the 1mg weekly dose, and it is rough. Since the start of this medication, I have had a general ""queasy"" feeling almost all the time. My appetite is definitely decreased. I have also had some dizziness and fatigue and it has interfered some with my workouts. I was eating low carb and exercising regularly before starting Wegovy, but was at a weight plateau. I started this because of my A1C (prediabetic) and triglyceride levels, and I believe weight loss will help both these numbers. I know to avoid weight regain, I will probably have to be on this indefinitely. At this point, however, I don't think I will go above the current 1mg dose, at least for a few months, because the side effects on this dose are pretty bad. Queasy all the time with intermittent nausea, constipation, fatigue, some dizziness during my workouts. I am hoping with time these will get better as the weight loss continues. I don't want to take Zofran, miralax, and colace forever."

I’m giving a review because mostly people with bad reactions leave reviews here and my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. It was working so well for me that I did each dose for a few months before increasing to the next level. I’m just now starting the 2.4mg dose and although I’m nervous, it’s worth it because the results are so good. 

I had a bmi of 31 when Istarted and now it’s is 24. I’ve lost about 28% of my body weight and now look and feel great. All my arthritis is gone! I did have some pretty significant nausea and constipation for a few months, but I only vomited once. Some headaches too and just not feeling great. But the longer you’re on it, it seems to get better and I mostly don’t have any side effects anymore. We will see with this new highest dose. 

When I had to stop for 4 months, I gained back about 14 lbs, so that’s why I started it up again. I intend to stay on it so that I can keep the weight off. Totally worth it, for me, and just hoping I don’t get any serious side effects from long term use. I recommend people try it if they qualify. You never know how your body will tolerate a new medicine and you might get lucky!"

Have tried all the diets, lost weight but have not been able to keep it off. A friend suggested Wegovy, since she lost weight on it. I asked my doctor and she prescribed it. 

In the first month I lost 10 lbs. When my prescription went to .5, I started losing weight a lot more slowly and having my first side effect, increased resting heart rate. I don't have any other side effects. With the increase in dosage however, I never feel full. 

To date, I'm on Wegovy for 7 weeks and have lost 13 lbs. I don't feel any different and am a bit disheartened that the weight loss is not as quick. I work out with a personal trainer twice weekly and go for daily walks. So far, I'm not really impressed."

In 10 weeks I've lost 22lbs, which is over 2lbs a week. This is a TOOL to help you lose weight. I workout 5 days a week, including strength training. I eat around 1200 calories, but that isn't hard, since the medication does curb cravings. I'm one of those people who has always eaten well and exercised, but after years of dieting and excessive restriction (even Anorexia), my body didn't want to work effectively anymore. For the first time maybeever, I'm able to eat things I wouldn't normally eat, and not gain weight- but in fact, lose. I don't restrict things, but as an overall healthy eater and Vegetarian, this works wonderfully for my lifestyle. People really need to do their research, though. You are meant to slowly titrate up the doses so that you can eliminate or reduce the side effects. There are ways to deal with the side effects when you have them- drink more water, eat plenty of protein, etc. The therapeutic dose doesn't even start til 1.0mg-1.7mg and many do not lose anything until then, so you have to be patient. I'm one of the lucky ones whose had great success from the beginning, but I do lead a healthy lifestyle. I feel like my body is finally working the way it's meant to. Exercise, choose foods to fuel your body, eat lots of protein so you don't lose muscle mass, and be patient. Don't compare your journey to anyone else's."

I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but this abdominal pain was by far the worst I have ever dealt with.

But- my GI tract is still not right. It took at least one week to deal with the aftermath of the hospital visit, and now, 3.5 weeks out frommy last dose, I still get queasy/nauseous 1-2 times weekly, so much so that I have to take Zofran, which barely touches it. And BTW- the nauseousness lasts for at least 12 hours, it's not a quick, passing thing. This ""medication"" is dangerous even when used correctly. I did read all these reviews before starting so was hesitant but went ahead anyway, and thought after a month that I skirted around any side effects, but I was totally wrong.

Wegovy  gave me abdominal cramps so bad I had to go an ER. I was very dehydrated and in so much pain. Luckily my CT was normal, but my WBC was elevated. Maybe this is some other side effect that will start being reported more often now that half the population seems to be taking it. I started at the 0.25 and did that weekly for 4 weeks. During that time, I was ok but constantly felt somewhat bloated and would burp way more than what would be considered normal. Then came 0.5, one dose. 6 days later I was in the ER. It's now 1 week later, and my GI tract is still not normal. I am glad some people had success with this but for me, my life was way better before this medication.

I am combining this with weight watchers so I am pretty careful about what I’m eating. Wegovy seems to make it possible for me to avoid the cravings I generally have.  Part of it has been fear of getting sick from all the reviews but I think it’s also that it makes me feel pretty full longer.  I do still experience hunger but I am definitely able to eat way less and still feel satisfied. my insurance covers it and it’s working so I’m happy to continue on the same dosage for another course (4 weeks).

I was miserable. I tried senacot  and Miralax together before I finally went. 
Thishas been a horrible and disappointing experience.  It has made me depressed and lethargic, not to mention the stomach pain every day. Last week I went to the .50 dose. Worst week of my life. I have eight grandchildren and can’t even enjoy them because I’m so sad and sick. I have struggled with weight loss since I was 50. Thank goodness I am tall or I would look like a cow.

I have been sick every 3-4 days with explosive diarrhea and vomiting. I cannot wait for it to get out of my system. The reason people are loosing so much weight on this is because you literally cannot eat.

First month was .25 mg and this month is .50, next month 1 mg, etc. Definitely learned after my first dose to do several things. Be super aware of what I eat on my dosing days and the next two days. Nothing fatty, unhealthy etc. that results in diarrhea. I always take Pepcid in the mornings now and on my dosing day and the next couple of days take another anti acid before I eat. I drink lots of water. Also one time I pushed the pen into myskin and it didn’t click to dispense the medication so I lifted up the pen and ended up wasting a lot of the medication ??. Lastly I always take out the pen out of the fridge on dosing days in the mornings then dose at night but not right before bed time. It sounds like a lot but I’m super happy and excited to be on this med. definitely notice the appetite decrease and I’m excited to see how things go once I get up to the 2.5 mg dose. All side effects have been manageable just need to readjust some things."

Took away appetite, unfortunately this is when the shortage started and I couldn’t refill for an entire year. Started up again .25 dose Feb 2023 and feel nothing. Did not take away appetite at all. Increased dosage to .50 and have been on that for a little over two weeks and still no noticeable change in appetite. Wondering if the rush to get the medication back on the shelves changed the med, as in 2022 the .25 worked amazingly.

One night I ate to much later and was sick through the night. This would happen before Wegovy but I was sicker. This has helped me not over eat late at night. I did Have Diarrhea one night and a little constipated nothing bad. My appetite is def less than before but you still have to work at it. I have loss 32 lbs in & weeks with a week at an all-inclusive resort where I did drink and ate what I wanted. I just took my last dose on .50 I will see how the other ones do.

I made very smart choices with my food and drank a lot of water. The third day I had a severe headache. Otherwise a little nauseous. I am down 8Lbs. So far so good!
Semaglutide,Wegovy,3/26/2023,Change4me2024,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for Overweight Person with BMI 27 to 29 and Weight-Related Comorbidity,4,4,4,4,1,0,"Started with the .25 dose, now one the 1 dose.  Working with my Nurse Practitioner to monitor side effects and tolerance to medication.  So far so good.  My Nurse Practitioner also has me adhering to proper nutrition and exercise in addition to taking the medication. 
Working with dietitian to change eating habits and that has been a good experience.  I like the approach because the first 3 months we focused on adding a new goal in terms of nutrition focus so as not to have to worry about everything at once.  My water, protein, carbs and fat each day are now where they should be for me.  Its not so overwhelming now trying to meet my daily goals.  The medication is just helping me not focus on food or being hungry while doing this.  
I have experienced some nausea after the injection but seems to go away after a day or so. We will see how this goes as the dosage increases.  Some foods i dont seem to tolerate as well but they are foods I should not have regulary as a part of my new behaviors anyway so I am ok with that.  Also now understand that those items are choices as well but should not be a regular choice so again the medication is helping with behavior changes. 
On the .25 and .5 dose i did lose weight but nothing remarkable, but this is probably more related to me working on smaller manageable Nutritional goals. 
I am have more significant loss each week with the 1g dose so I imagine this will continue as the dose increases.
After reading some of the reviews I would say your best experience with the medication is partnering with a provider who knows about the treatment of obesity so that you can get all the tools needed to have a good experience.  The medication alone is not enough."

I just took my 6th injection today 3/23/23, and am currently at 35 pounds. My BP has already dropped from 130s/90s, to 90s/70s, and have been removed from my first BP Med. 

Ease of Use: Once you get the needle out of your head, it is an easy injection. Both injections on 1.0 have been 'light', as it doesnt feel like the needle is going as deep as the last 8 doses. Todays dose wasleaky, even with the needle in and pressing hard. I'll try again next week to see, it'll still do it's job even if some leaked out.

Satisfaction: Overall I'm satisfied, I haven't had much of a change in taste, but have noticed I am definitely more sensitive to smells triggering retching. Nausea for .25 and .5 were very mild, with 1.0 being on the slightly higher side of moderate. The night of the first 1.0, was horrible; But that was my own doing, having eaten heavier foods through the day before the injection, today seems to be back to a more mild sensation, eating like I had been the previous dose days. My partner has been absolutely supportive through this, adjusting his diet to closer to mine. I've mostly stuck to a sausage egg and cheese JD Delight sandwich for breakfast, raw veggies with a yogurt based dressing, or chicken patties with salsa for lunch, and pretty much whatever has been made for dinner. I have greatly reduced overall carb intake, getting closer to a keto diet but not strict. Something you MUST do is tell yourself to eat. My first 2 days after my first injection were very hanger ragey. Lesson learned. Beef seems to be a trigger food for nausea now. One side effect I've experienced more often than anything has been dizziness on standing. The first time I experienced it, it was quick as I was actually getting up from crouching; I actually had to lay down for a minute to come back to myself. Since then, I've either sat back down or just stood and braced myself against something. The removal from the first BP med seems to have really lightened up that side effect though. Outside of that, I am gassy from both ends, but I can't tell if that's the Wegovy or the CPAP at this time; Probably both... but the drug is doing what it's designed to do. I am trying to tell myself to endulge more, as I am somewhat concerned with how fast the weight is coming off... thinking maybe my blood sugar has been getting lower than it should be (have never been diagnosed diabetic), but feel like that could have also been contributing to the dizziness. It has mostly curbed my sweet tooth, I do endulge in a little bit as dessert towards the end of the night, usually a serving of peanut butter cups, trying to include more fruit as well; But overall just learning to be more mindful of what I'm actually putting in, since I'm eating about 1/3 of what I would have before, so that what is going in is actually nutritious. I haven't started getting back into the gym yet, but am planning on it and becoming more active as the weather is getting nicer. I work from home, and have become accustomed to... remaining warm, since I'm now also cold much more easily.

TL:DR, you have to figure out what works for you, what triggers symptoms more severely and how to mitigate them. Having a support system WITH you, not just online, via people who are willing to make these changes alongside you also makes a HUGE difference."

I've been losing at a rate that is slow but very steady.  I am convinced that like many things, the reviews here are naturally an adverse selection in that people with a bad experience are far more likely to write reviews.

I am 3 months in. 1 month .25 and 2 months .5. This medicine helps me eat less. I'm never starving between meals and when I do eat I simply don't want as much.

Semaglutide,Wegovy,3/14/2023,SJV,55-64,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I have been on Wegovy for 5 weeks. The shots are so painless, I sometimes check to make sure I was the autoject pen actually worked (I inject in my abdoment. I have lost 15 pounds rather effortlessly. The main benefit I have noticed is I am no longer fixated on food. I don't think about eating constantly or have the desire to snack throughout the day nor do I eat voraciously. I started off at 231 pounds (I am a 56 year old male, 5' 10"" tall). That weight put me in the obese category with a BMI of 30. After five weeks, I am at 215 pounds. 

I have reduced my caloric intake by at least 1/2. I am fuller faster and can stop eating with food still on the plate. It has also increased my ability to reject evening snacks. I still think about them occasionally but I am able to resist the urge rather easily. 

As far as side effects, there have been a few minor ones. I started off with a dose of .25 mg and on month two it was increased to .50 mg. The side effects I have experienced were mild to moderate and only happened when I ate too much food i.e. binging. When I ate more than a human being should, I had stomach aches, mild nausea, cramps, and acid reflux. Again, this correlates directly to overeating. The psychological effect of cause and effect (eat too much and suffer moderate physical discomfort) is also beneficial to changing my relationship with food.  I learned rather quickly that binging has a negative consequence. 

I think many of the negative stories about Wegovy can be traced to people either being initially given too large a dose or people thinking this is a miracle drug that will allow you to eat the way that made you obese and still lose weight. It is not a panacea that will allow you to continue to overeat. It is a significant resource to curb cravings and slow down digestion making you feel fuller with less food and also holding you accountable for your bad eating habits should you try to continue them. 

I have found that increasing your water intake and adding fiber supplements to your diet can minimize the side effects of constipation and diarrhea. 

My goal weight is 185. If I can maintain my current weight loss trajectory, I should hit that in three to four months. I had almost given up on losing weight until I was able to get this drug. I am extremely happy with the results and feel the minor side effects I have experienced are completely acceptable and manageable. If used as part of a reduced-calorie diet and with added physical activity, I believe Wegovy can help many people reach healthier weights in relatively short periods of time with minimal side effects."

The third day is where it all fell apart. I had a hypoglycemic attack at work from not eating enough due to the severe nausea. I was able to get a few bites of chocolate and crackers down and went home. I'd already messaged my doc about the nausea and he called in some Zofran. My husband picked themup and brought them home to me. I took one and laid down. About an hour later, I sat straight up and flew to the bathroom. I projectile vomited harder than I ever have in my life. I could hardly catch my breath it was coming out so fast. Then the diarrhea hit and I was doing both at the same time. And if that wasn't enough, I had another hypoglycemic attack during all of that. I was pouring sweat. It was running off of me like I was standing in the rain, rapid heart rate, dizzy and my blood sugar was so low I was barely responsive when my husband came to check on me. He called 911 and I stayed 3 days in the hospital receiving fluids, glucose and nausea meds. I'm home now but I'm still nauseous, bloated and my kidneys are hurting now.

I started Wegovy and just took my 4th week's dose of 0.25mg. I have not had any side effects and found it to be a very effective appetite suppressant. I have, like many others, tried dieting and dieting programs, my last one was Metabolic Weight Loss center. This is a keto-esque program that bids you to increase protein, lower carbs, lots of water, exercise, yada yada yada. But, of course those things don't work very well for me and I feel like a failure, or it does work for a while and then I gain weight again as I live my life. I am a stress/boredom eater, and also eat larger portions that I should. Wegovy was prescribed due to my starting weight of 215 lbs @ 5'7'', and elevated cholesterol levels, which I am on medication for. I did increase my exercise, from nil to trying to go to aquatic exercises, 2-3x/week for 45 mins. So far, I am down to 204 lbs without much effort. I realize that a significant weight loss will be very helpful with my back issues going forward and hopefully will relieve painful flare ups with arthritis, degenerative disc disease, for which i get cortisone injections a few times a year, and allow me to not have to use a CPAP machine.  But, I am a bit concerned that I may begin having side effects with the elevated dosages and may ask if I can stay on lower doses for a longer pd of time, especially since it is working. I read that sometimes people have gallbladder problems if they lose too much weight too soon, so I definitely want to avoid any of that.  Also, to be honest, I am concerned what will happen when I finish with this rx and what tools will I be able to use to keep all or much of the weight off. I will also disclose that I did research all of the common medications for weight loss that are now being used. My Endocrinologist said that Wegovy was one of the better weight loss drugs, and that it not only helps with weight loss but in some cases may save many lives as well from diabetes and heart disease."

I read many reviews before deciding to give this a shot in desperation to lose weight! I was hoping that the bad reviews were winers but low and behold they were correct!! I consider myself tough with a pretty tough stomach but I got to dose one of the .5 and third night I am still sick as a dog I feel pukey all day and every time I barely eat something healthy in a small portion I feel like I’m food poisoned for hours!! I took a prescription ondansetron 4 mg for nausea and itdidn’t touch it, severe headache extra strength Tylenol didn’t touch it, diarrhea… you get the picture… I have lost like 1 pound and feel like I was doing better than this on my own! Matter of fact I feel that it’s keeping me from losing any weight which is weird since I’ve barely eaten and normally would lose weight … I’m questioning the people who are able to stomach this stuff, are you really human or possibly part alien lol. I would NOT recommend this drug, I just hope I haven’t damaged my body in any way and can’t wait until this drug is washed out if my system, waste of time and money.. the rest is going in the garbage!!

The first month has been all about adjustment and transitioning to a new way of thinking. Wegovy is a tool to help curb appetite and cravings, which it does for me. In the past, while decreasing food intake for weight loss, I was always so hungry  - and now I am not, and this has been amazing. My cravings for salty snacks and sugar have decreased significantly. I eat a smaller amount of the bad stuff and am satisfied. 

My barriers at this point are psychological - I still want to eat too much at the wrong times, I still want to drink wine, neither of which should you do on this medication. Your GI tract slows, and food and drink stay in your GI tract longer. If you overeat, you will feel awful. If you drink too much alcohol, you will feel awful. In an effort not to feel awful, I have been adjusting portion size and when I eat. I am trying to be aware of these issues - this has been why I have only lost about 3-4 pounds in 5-weeks. Still a victory considering how difficult it is for me to lose weight. (50yo F, 5’10”, starting 232#, current 228#.)

The only side effect I had during the first month was fatigue. It was significant! However, my PCP suggested increasing my protein (wow, was I not getting enough), and I also became more mindful of hydration. An increase in protein, and hydration, and a decrease in meal portion and wine turned it around. I feel great now! But it wasn’t easy. The struggle is real, still. Lots of work left! Fingers crossed for the next 6-weeks!"

I use another type of auto injector pen for different medicine which requires that I push the pen against my skin, then I press a button which quickly plunges the needle into my skin and injects the medicine.

I am writing to share in the very poor 1 star section an observation about the comments posted here. First, there are quite a few in which the dose does not begin at .25 but much higher, including in one case 1.7mg because the lowest dose was unavailable. The instructions tell the user to work up the levels starting with .25mg so it is understandable you can become quite sick starting with much higer doses. Second, people claimno weight loss at all despite being on the med for months. However they don't share whether they are exercising and eating a low calorie diet. One person said he lost nothing including his appetite so just ate as normal. Maybe his dose had to be higher? Finally, one person claimed to have extreme vomiting, headaches, etc. and that he was eating 500 calories per day.  500 calories is not a low calorie diet that is starvation. Perhaps that is why he had terrible side effects.  In summary, if you are going to complain and be dissatisfied (or even super happy) do explain the basics about your diet, your exercise, on what dosage you have had the problem.  Thanks for sharing."

I have not had much weight loss, three pounds total but my body losses weight very slowly.  I have noticed that you must make a couple of accommodations to this medication.  1.  Drink water.  Seriously, drink a lot of water.  It truly mitigates the side effects if you don't drink water then you will notice a lot of side effects.  2.  Watch spicy foods. The heart burn is very real if you eat spicy foods or if you skip meals.  You have to do some trials to see whichfoods your body will tolerate.  I have read about others having issues with fried foods, I don't eat fried foods but I can see it could be problematic.  3. Don't overeat.  Listen to that ""full"" signal your body is sending you.  Over eating leads to some bad side effects.  Just realize you are only able to take in so much food at once. 4.  Plan what you eat and prioritize nutrient dense foods.  You can only eat so much so you need to plan your meals.  

Adapting to this medication is not difficult if you listen to your body.  I am still learning how to live on this medication but I am confident in the long run it will work.  I also meet with my Doctor once a month to ensure that everything is ok."

Started on the .25mg injection and woke up the next day thinking I had covid or influenza because I had HORRIBLE body aches and fatigue. Went to the Dr and was negative for both so then it dawned on me it might be the Wegovy. Could barely  function for the next 3 days I felt so bad and was extremely fatigued. Decided maybe that was just a bad reaction to the first injection so went ahead with the 2nd. 24 hrs later the fatigue is worse, keep falling asleep while working from home and in the evenings.

I have noticed as I have gotten older it is in my head with the thought I am hungry plus I am a stress eater so I needed help more so with the “food intake” piece.  I started this journey in September starting at 247 pounds.  I do t want to pretend it has been so wonderful because my body hasdefinitely seen the wrath in good and bad ways.  I started out the first month at .25mg and am now in January 2023 worked up to 2.5mg.  The first month I didn’t see much in weight loss but definitely noticed a HUGE difference in my appetite.  After the first month I did see the weight start to fall off.  I want to add I was not exercising at all.  My food intake was less and then came some of the not so pleasant things.  Diarrhea, stomach pain, breaking out in a full body sweat but thankfully no throwing up.  However, all of that I described was just as bad.  This would happen when I would make a poor food choice that maybe had a little grease or spice in it.  I did pay for these decisions and for a while I thought this was going to be the new norm and I along with my husband asked myself more than once is it worth it.  I can still say almost February 2023 it is.  I haven’t had one of those spells at 3am for a long time now but I also don’t eat like I once did.  I am now down over 40lbs and still have a ways to go with this journey.  I will say and want to stress everyone is different including how your body will react to this.  Just like any weight loss you want to take this slow and start with the lower dose to get your body used to this as well as that is what your Dr should be giving.  I know we are a world who wants to see results right now but with this you will just give it time and don’t force higher doses or you could be quitting before you truly begin due to side affects.  Some takeaways for me.  When you are prescribed this make sure to ask for some anti nausea medication as well.  I have zofran and I am positive that is the only reason I didn’t have vomiting with my side affects.  If you have sulfer burps which I started experiencing the end of December get on some anti acid medication.  I take omeprezol and it is a life saver.  Also try and remember why you are doing this.  I look at my parents (who I have now introduced to this as well) and want to be on better health and be there for my husband, kids and now grandchild.  You have to consider what is best for you.  Don’t feel guilty for wanting to help yourself, just be smart about it.  We all go at different paces and I do believe after the research and my own experience this works.  Good Luck"
Semaglutide,Wegovy,1/24/2023,Sungoddess,55-64,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,,1,"Been on Wegovy for 3 weeks now.  The first week I actually felt full for the first time in 40 years where I didn't want to keep eating like I usually do.  I literally cried.  Feeling full is such a wonderful feeling.  I do need to train myself to stop eating when I'm full, that it's ok to not eat everything on my plate since I'm a compulsive overeater and that it's taboo to leave food on your plate. Once I eat my first meal of the day and I'll stop when I'm full, I'm then full for the rest of the day and don't even want to eat dinner.  I believe that eating very small meals during the day will be a benefit for me in making sure I don't starve myself. I really don't want to eat because of feeling full and that's scary for me.  I am getting help professionally in re-teaching my mind.  My sleep schedule is off, I'm wide awake at night and I do get sick to my stomach with a headache more so in the evening then during the day.  I've also noticed that my taste buds have changed and I'm not tasting the food that same way before I started Wegovy.  I've also noticed that my sense of smell is off as well.  I am so stoked to losing 100 plus pounds and pray that I'll be able to stop taking Wegovy without going back to my old ways once the weight is off. Long way to go so I'm not dwelling on it.  Good luck to everyone who is taking Wegovy for weight loss."

I've tried and failed at diets and exercise programs for most of my adult life. I can lose weight with extreme calorie restriction and exercise, but the miserable extremes I have to go to are unsustainable in the long-term. Now menopause is looming, and the weight has been creeping up, even with diet and exercise. 

I started 0.25 mg Wegovy in late Dec, and will be taking my 4th shot tomorrow. I have experienced mild appetite suppression, enough tohelp me shed almost 3 lbs so far (yeah, it's still hard). I have definitely reduced my food intake, and do find it easier to eat smaller portions and make healthier choices, as my cravings are somewhat reduced. I found that my 3rd shot didn't produce the same appetite suppression as the first two, so I'm hoping that graduating to 0.5 mg will give stronger effects. I travel a lot for work, so it can be difficult to make healthy choices on the road, but Wegovy does seem to help.

I have experienced very mild side effects: slight nausea (mostly just when I wake up an night to pee) and constipation (I suffer with this anyway, and take Metamucil, stool softeners, and magnesium). The last few days I've become exhausted in the afternoons and MUST take a quick nap, but I've also been under a tremendous amount of work/family stress, so that could explain it. 

Overall I'm happy with Wegovy, and feel optimistic for the future. My (new as of 1/1/23) insurance provider (BCBS) denied my pre-auth due to lack of 3 months of diet and lifestyle modification, but my doctor is appealing, as I've been doing that for 30 years! Fingers crossed."

I’ve still lost about 6 pounds in the past week but unfortunately can’t continue.  I’m one of the very few people who this has happened to, however, it was a possible side effect.

I followed Mounjaro’s plan for 3 months until the $25 trials ended. During the mounjaro trial I lost 45 pounds in 90 days. I need to add I went on a protein shake diet. There were a few carbs thrown in there, but I really tried to go to as few carbs as possible. 

Now that Wegovy is available again and my insurance covers it, I’m on Wegovy. I started on a low dose compared to where I was on Mounjaro. The 1st week didn’t produce much weight loss or appetite control. My Doc doubled my dose and I definitely can feel a difference. My appetite is gone again. 

One word of warning about Mounjaro. In my case the constipation was off the chart. I had to be very careful what I ate and if was much at all (a slice of pizza at a party did 
me in) I had to use stool softeners, a laxative and eventually drink mineral oil to break up the road block. Seriously bad situation. Be careful."

With that being said, I did make healthy-ish choices: soup, salad, salmon, grilled chicken...It is painless and easy to use. I was nervous to administer my own shot but they made it very easy.

Reducing one’s weight is never going to be easy and this does require trial and error at first.  Very few issues after 6 weeks. I now inject on Friday evenings in case I am mildly tired Day One or Day Two.  Never both days.  Ask your doc for an anti-nausea medication before you start as you may need it the first several weeks.  Works great!    One that doesn’t make you drowsy.  Also have Tums and/or Pepcid. You will quickly learn sitting up straight allows you to quickly release acid buildup. Immediate relief.  Will also need to increase fiber and perhaps consider stool softener.  Stay on top of this and don’t hesitate to ask your doc about your symptoms versus being miserable.  As with any weight loss, a steady, but small decline is great.  Don’t worry if you plateau on occasion.  But we can’t continue eating the same things and not exercising!  I’m not a clinical person but I do suspect some people have more issues because they have more health issues overall."

This week, I expected to see a big drop, as last week I went up 0.2 lbs.  I am extremely disappointed.  My food intake has decreased.  I did not have the nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that some have reported.  I was not eating much when I started the medication, and that may be why.   I did have extreme fatigue which I countered by drinking Zipfizz (electrolytes and vitamins - specifically B).  I was ready to quit and they bumped me up this week, so we'll see if I start losing.  I started at 268 and now am at 263.2.  Less than 5 lbs in 4 weeks.  For the cost and the risk, so far it is not worth it.  In 2019 I lost almost 40 lbs doing Keto and Carb Manager.  My weight started creeping back, and I thought I'd try this ""no diet"" wonder drug.  I was hoping that using this medication would allow me to put fruit and whole grains back into my diet and help me limit those carbs.  Unfortunately, it just may be for my body, Keto is the only plan that works.  I just got sick of counting everything.  The center said that you don't really start losing weight until the dosage is increased and that they want to make sure your body tolerates it well.  I paid for 10 weeks, but am thinking that it just isn't going to be effective for me.  I would have been happy with 2 lbs per week, which, I don't think is too much to ask given the cost.  If I have to count carbs and calories, what is the point?  Keto keeps away the insulin spikes so you're not hungry.  This was supposed to be effortless... but if you've already changed your diet and don't eat much, it just might not work.  Maybe it's my age and being post menopausal.

Week 2: I had every side effect listed for three days, if you want to know how bad I felt just think of either the worst hangover you have ever experienced, or the worst morning sickness! Luckily I work my own hours so I could stay in bed. But if you have a 9 - 5 job, you will be calling is sick! You cannot function. No weight loss. 
Week 3: Again for threedays, I had all of the side effects as week two, but could sorta function. Lost 3 lbs. 
Week 4: Injection last night, and have started to feel sick again. 
Is it worth it? Well I have two more weeks left of a VERY expensive medication. I will power thru it, see if the side effects subside, and what the overall weight loss is and then decide."

Took away my appetite for sure. Was it easy to use, yes. Was I satisfied, no. I threw up and had diarrhea for 14 hours. Started an hour after I used the injection.

Semaglutide,Wegovy,10/29/2022,Jules,45-54,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Weight Loss Management for Overweight Person with BMI 27 to 29 and Weight-Related Comorbidity,3.6666666666666665,4,4,3,1,0,"Been on it for exactly one week, it was an interesting week.  I may find that I come back and add another review later that is rated higher, 

 Brief background on me, I have been a gym rat since 2008, very healthy, I eat lean chicken, veggies, and complex carbs, no added sugars, no processed foods and only drink water, green tea, and milk... 

 but I was post-menopausal in my late 30s and which caused massive weight gain (60 pounds), though my diet and exercise never changed.  

Got on HRT andlost 20lbs but could not get under 200lbs. My weight fluctuated between 200-230 for 3 years..  I even intermittently fasted. 

 I asked my doctor about Wegovy and I was given a prescription.  My labs are good, no high glucose so insurance wouldn't cover it.  I filled my script at a compound pharmacy.  They mix it with B12 and I get it for $150 per month. 

 I  need to go from 211 pounds to 150.  The pharmacist told me to take 15-20 units. 

 The next day I took 18 units and felt great!  Not hungry, very focused, no side effects- I always drink a gallon of water a day...  

In comes the nightmare of my first night... 

 I normally take 1/2 of CBD gummy at night to help me get a full 8 hours of sleep... so as usual, I ate it and went to bed at 10 pm.  

At 10:30pm I got super hot, dizzy and massive sweats...so much that my hair was soaked.  I ended up passing out in the bathroom, falling face down... I had to be rushed to the hospital as I kept losing consciousness, I had all the severe side effects, minus nausea.

  After about 7 hours I was released.  

Turns out, that the CDB interacted with it, and plus I was only supposed to take 12 units. The combo of CBD AND taking too much (not preloaded injectors) caused severe reactions. 

 I have been fine since.  

No more CBD!  

 My current problem now is am not sleeping at night.   So I am unclear if the CBD gummy caused the reaction or if it did so because I took too many units of Wegovy.. either way, I am waking up at 3 am.. ugh.  I don't know what to do to stay asleep as I am scared of taking ANYTHING to help me sleep as I never want to experience what I did the first night.   

Taking the sleep issue out of the equation.  I lost 8 pounds in my first week and I feel fine. This is the first time in 3 years the scale or my measurements MOVED DOWNWARDS! 

Those who want to take this: Make sure you tell your doctor EVERYTHING!  

You have to change your diet to avoid nausea, gas, and those types of side effects.   Eating carbs, sugary things or over-eating will cause stomach issues.   

Cool it on the caffeine and get plenty of water.  keep track of your food and how you are feeling and stay in contact with your healthcare provider.  

If I can go back to 8 hours of sleep, then I can raise my rating.  I am looking forward to this journey of finally moving out of the category of Obese!  I will be contacting my doctor to see what we can do about my sleep. Other than that, I am satisfied."

Wegovy was an absolute game-changer for me in terms of hunger and being able to portion control.  I have always felt hungry, could not skip meals and this absolutely gave me the power to portion control and take it or leave it in terms of food.  A couple of bites and I am good now!  It's absolutely remarkable.  The side affects are minimal too, some burping and tiredness but nothing consequential.  I'm a 52 yo menopausal woman - 5'7"" and now around 137#."

I want to be clear though.  I was worried about side effects so I've done exactly what my doctor said.  I did not overeat.  I did feel fuller when taking it.  I also generally exercise 5 days per week.  The reason I began the program with Wegovy was because with my regular diet and exercise, I was not seeing results - none.  So, I took drastic measures and got on the program.  So far, so good."

The only side effect I did experience was a little bit of nausea in the morning. I had used with Wegovy for seven months and have currently been off of it now for four month and continued to still lose weight. My insurance covered it and I had to pay $100 per month, but if you go onto the Wegovy website and sign up for their training you get a prescription card that makes that will go be only $25."

I'm barely 5 ft tall and aging. I've fought my weight for so many years that it was depressing and exhausting. I lost over 70 lbs in 2020 and gained most of it back between summer of 2021 into Spring of 2022. I did not know anything about wegovy until Spring of 2022. I've lost an average of 10 lbs a month and I'm currently down 58 lbs going into my 6 months of using wegovy. I hate giving myself a shot but this works. Side effects for me are minimal. Someoneelse posted it's like a gastric bypass without surgery. I would say compared to what I watched my mom go through because she opted for the surgery this is close on the effectiveness but the side effects are not as bad as undergoing surgery. I would recommend to anyone that has been in the battle for a long time and it seems like nothing works. It works if you stay with it and push through the not so great days. The good days outweigh the bad.

I started at 247lbs standing at 5’9” I did show as Obese on my BMI. I am now 177lbs which means I have lost 70 lbs in 5 months. This medication is a miracle worker but I have spent about $100 on vitamins, laxatives, and other medications to help with the side effects. If you are serious about weight loss the side effects are just something you have to deal with. I have nausea, constipation, vomiting, low iron, and a multitude of just other little things. I highly recommend buying ginger ale, multi vitamins, vitamin D, and a probiotic to help reduce symptoms. I LOVE WEGOVY!"

Use some Zofran 1st two weeks for nausea.  I have learned what I can and cannot eat on this medicine.   More of a mediterranean or paleo diet.  Has been wonderful for me.  Lost 40 lbs since March.  Listen to your body tell you it is full.  If you over eat, you will be miserable for a while.  One word of advise... You cannot eat late and go to bed.  You will have indigestion, nausea, etc as mentioned in the other comments.READ ABOUT THE MEDICINE, then decide it it is for you."

I've lost 11 pounds even though I skipped a week( the fifth week) when I went on a summer trip that involved a long flight. (I didn't want to be sick over the Pacific and stuck on a plane.) My insurance surprisingly covered it, probably bc I have tried all sorts of things over years to lose weight.  I started off needing to lose 20 pounds but hopefully 30.  I was quite sick with vomiting the very first dose of the first week, for oneday.  Hwr, since then I take a Zofran an hour before the injection and do this right before bed.  I have experienced all the negative side effects at some point or another, but feel they are all manageable. I'm a bit frightened to go up to the 2.4mg dose, but I'm just planning ahead for a couple of rough days.The worst for me is the fatigue. I used to work out more, but now I'm without energy. I'm just making the choice to do it anyway, and I do feel better when I do. I do not plan to take this medication for the rest of my life, but I'm not sure how getting off of it looks. I am very curious about the science of this medicine and how to stay at a healthy BMI without it.  I was prescribed Plentity before this, and I stockpiled it with the plan to take it after I finish Wegovy. My doctor isn't sure this will work."

I did not, fortunately. Some loss of appetite, but I figured that was kinda the point, at least at first. I had a little nasua the 
first week on .5, but it went awayin a couple of weeks and never came back.  When I do eat, I enjoy my food. I am just able to eat less, and less frequently, without being uncomfortable or stressed. I have been on it for about 10 months now, topping off at 2 mg. I have lost over 30 pounds, which since I am short was almost 25% of my body weight and has made a tremendous difference. It would be best if I lose about 7 to 10 pounds more to be at my healthiest weight but have been a little stuck for the last couple of months. My doctor is increasing dose to 2.25 which is still a little lower than the prescribed dose of 2.4 used  in the study. I am optimistic that will do the trick. I LOVE this medication. Highly recommend!!"

I'm literally afraid to eat while taking this. The heartburn is like nothing I've ever experienced and now I'm on the 2.4 dose and have decided I am DONE.

I'm just starting my 14th week (2nd 1.7 dose) and have lost 26 lbs so far. My side effects thus far have been super mild compared to what I've read here; some mild nausea and constipation, but that's really it, and I guess I'm tired a bit, but I can't separate that from the rest of my normal life, stress, whatever. I haven't slept well in eons, so it is more likely related to adulting in general, and not med-related. I get nervous at every jump in strength, but so far, that hasn't been an issue either. I guess we'll find out when I jump to the maintenance dose. My biggest frustration has been with price (my insurance doesn't cover it) and accessibility, and my biggest fear is maintenance when I finally (if I ever) reach my goal weight. This obviously isn't sustainable forever (who can afford that?!) but I will appreciate the jumpstart it's given me, I guess regardless of where I net out down the road. Good luck all!"
Semaglutide,Wegovy,7/27/2022,Robert,45-54,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,4,4,4,4,1,0,"I have been on Wegovy for 2 months and have dropped 40 pounds. This is good, but it comes at a cost. The drug has totally changed my relationship with food. I always loved food. Every meal was an event I looked forward to, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. But due to childhood trauma (being starved as an infant), I always ate way too much. Sometimes 3 or 4 times what might be considered a normal portion. 

Since taking wegovy, I can't enjoy food at all anymore. Eating even a small amountmakes me feel ill. Swallowing itself causes pain. I've never vomited and the feeling passes eventually. But I no longer look forward to meals and sometimes I'll just skip eating altogether because I don't want to go through the hassle and pain.

I feel like the protagonist in Clockwork Orange. I've been conditioned by a drug to hate one of the things I've always loved most. It's the mental strain of this situation that has caused me the most stress. Far more than the nausea and pain of eating itself. 

But I need to accept it, or face weight related conditions like diabetes, heart attack and stroke. Living longer to see my grandchildren grow up outweighs my passion for food. So, I'll keep taking my shot. Unless they invent a pill that allows you to eat as much as you want and never gain weight."

Like many here, finding the correct dosage was a challenge, even resulting in delayed refills. I found the vomiting was worse after a delayed dose. I hope to be able to live with the nausea, fatigue and extreme vomiting long enough to lose at least another 80 lbs. I have found that the day of taking Wegovyand the next 3 days are the worst, but of course by then the next dose is around the corner.

Most of my side effects are during the first few days of the injection. I have lost 10 lbs within the first month but then nothing so far since. I have considered stopping multiple times due to the side effects. I have random bouts of nausea but worse in the morning when first waking up and i take a few drinks of pickle juice and it goes away usually. Worse than the nausea for me is the intense fatigue. I nap daily and have no energy to exercise for the first few days after my injections. On the lower doses i was getting outside and exercising but it causes so bad fatigue and weakness it’s hard now. All in all for me, i don’t think losing 10 lbs has been worth giving up my entire summer being sick form this med and unable to enjoy stuff. Perhaps if i had a 30 or 40 lb loss that would be different. I plan to give it 2 more weeks and if i haven’t lost at least 8 lbs I’ll stop it."

So far I am down 26 pounds and have managed to loose weight weekly.  My appetite has definitely decreased tremendously, it really surprised me how quickly it worked.  Some of the side effects I have had are nausea, constipation, diarrhea and abdominal cramping.  The cramping is definitely uncomfortable but fortunately only happens to me about once a week.  I’ve also noticed if I eat certain foods 
(greasy foods mostly)  it can make thecramping worse. Overall  I eat pretty healthy and have no cravings for sweets or chocolate! I will eat it on occasion but do not get the same satisfaction from eating it as I did pre-wegovy.  It’s very important to drink a lot of fluids, on days I feel blah I will drink Gatorade or Powerade zero and that has really helped. I have also taken Zofran a handful
of times in the last 10 weeks. I’m very happy with the results and  each week it gets easier to tolerate.   I have no regrets and have recommended it to others and am very hopeful I will get to the max dose of 2.4.  as far as supply I have been lucky and  able to find it. Most of the shortages are with the .25-1mg. dose, I did have to call four pharmacies to find the 1mg. 
Overall, I am pleased with the results and will continue to use it."

I was barely able to eat or drink much water.  When I did eat, I would always get nauseous and would eventually vomit.  I lost 20lbs in 7 was but purely due to starvation.   I have never felt worse.  I dont recommend this medication."
Semaglutide,Wegovy,6/12/2022,Laura,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,I game changer for me. 25# down but the bigger take away is the shift in my relationship with food and eating. I am thrilled.
Semaglutide,Wegovy,6/11/2022,Hopeful,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,4,5,3,4,1,0,"I’m a 56 year old female, 5’11” and started out at 227 pounds. I have struggled with my weight since high school. Like many, I’ve had temporary weight loss successes, regaining everything and then some, each time. My realistic goal is to be 195lbs. My ideal goal is 180lbs. I have currently lost 23 lbs and have been on the program for approximately 6 weeks.
 I began the standard titration schedule in April 2022. Luckily, my insurance covers the medication!! Due to a pharmacy glitch, I only had one of the .25 doses before jumping to .5. The result was 3 miserable days of the gut wrenching vomiting described elsewhere in these reviews. I contacted Novo Nordisk to ask questions and report my experience and was told I would be receiving a call, which I never got.
My titration schedule since the week 2 glitch, has been smooth. I’ve chosen to have my Rx filled by a large mail-out pharmacy, reasoning that they will get inventory priority over my small town local pharmacy. So far I have not experienced the medication shortages suffered by others. 
I am currently one week in on the 1.7 dose. I have no intention of stopping the medication, but it is definitely not a walk in the park.
Intermittent nausea, deep fatigue, headaches, constipation, general feelings of yuckiness, plus  my initial bout with vomiting, have made this a difficult journey. Zofran is my friend. My goal is to stay on the medication for at least two months at the 2.4 dose, giving my body plenty of time to adjust.  My credo is that I would rather be sick for a little while than fat for the rest of my life. 
I have had no hair loss (an adverse effect  reported in these reviews but not in the Wegovy literature), nor have I had any other serious or life threatening side effects.
Like most, I have an extremely reduced appetite as well as a distinct change in the type of foods I find appealing. Like another reviewer, I can’t tolerate heavy greasy foods. Fresh and frozen fruit are my favorites. I have increased thirst and find myself guzzling ice water (I also happen to live in New Mexico which has literally been on fire for the past 6 weeks, contributing, I’m sure, to my feelings of being parched).
Overall, I’m extremely grateful to finally have a chance at real and lasting weight loss. My knees hurt less, my self image has improved, my clothes are more comfortable and less tent-like. Moving around is easier in general. I’m no longer embarrassed by how much food I consume. I’m still too ashamed to be seen in a bathing suit, but soon even that will be a possibility (I want to start swimming again). I have hope again."

I was taking my ambulance where i developed pericardial effusion and was hospitalized for 2 weeks.  I also developed A-FIB.

Cycled through 0.25, .05 and 1.0 doses with no major issues. Started 1.7 dose just as I got COVID. Horrible side effects (almost ended up in the ER from dehydration) and could not tolerate the 1.7 dose so my PCP recommended I go back down to 0.5 and cycle through again until my body could handle the higher dose.

Just finished my time on 0.5 dose and now cannot get any 1.0 dose pens from my pharmacy. The drug manufacturer has no supply of 1.0. Apparently there is now a national shortage. They are saying they should have some in ""the second half of 2022"". Not sure what that means - June? December? Glad the manufacturer is being so transparent. My pharmacy told me to start calling around to see if anyone has any Wegovy and they will transfer my prescription. Who has time for that? 

Basically this drug manufacturer has left their customers high and dry. There was ZERO communication that there was a supply problem. I would not have cycled through doses a second time if I had known I was going to have to go off it again. I won't be waiting around for them to decide to actually supply the drug to consumers. I certainly will not be cycling through doses a second time.

For anyone who has not started Wegovy - don't bother. Since they cannot guarantee supply, I would not start down this road. You can't just stop, start and jump doses unless you want potentially severe side effects. 

Clearly this drug manufacturer does not care about the people using this medication since, ""Novo execs are pleased with Wegovy’s launch so far."" Not sure how they are pleased with a launch that leaves patients high and dry and having to discontinue use of the drug after MONTHS of stepping up doses. This drug costs me $1300+ per month so this is not something I take lightly, not to mention the health impacts. I feel I have wasted over $10,000 in drug costs. Glad Novo is ""pleased"" with that."

Semaglutide,Wegovy,5/12/2022,Linds,25-34,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,4,4,4,4,1,0,"0.25: on this dosage for 4 weeks. Nausea the first few days after taking a dose, but not bad. Noticeably less hungry and less cravings. Slight fatigue. 

0.5: noticeably more fatigue and nausea. Still losing weight (down from 177 to 165 at this point). HORRIBLE diarrhea 3 days after 2nd dose- could be period related but omg I’ve never experienced that kind of pain before, which lasted about 12 hrs. 

1: I just took my second dose of 1mg. Not hungry at all. Fatigue not as bad this week. Nausea isalmost crippling, but I’m trying to stick it out. Down to 161lbs. 

Overall, for me, this med has been very effective as far as weight loss, but very difficult to enjoy normal life with the side effects. I will probably quit when I finish this pack. 

Also, it’s $860 per month with the discount from manufacturer, which is ridiculous."

My problem started just into my third month.  My hair start falling out in big clumps.  I am 7 months into stopping it and I had had to cut my hair short as I had so many lengths it looked awful.  I have been a stressful time.  I called the company to let them know of my hair loss and someone was supposed to call me back but never did.  I still do not see hair loss on the Wegovy site as a possible side effect.  I wish it would get put on as one just so people can make a decision as to if this is something they can live with.

I can’t abide anything greasy, spicy, or unhealthy, so that helps, too.  2) The side effects range from tough to terrible.  Fatigue, hair loss, constipation AND diarrhea, but the worst for me is the horrible nausea. I vomited every time I increased a dose and often for no apparent reason.  This is full-on, empty-your-entire-stomach-until-your-throat-is-scraped-raw-vomiting.  Yesterday I moved to 1.7 and have had constant vomiting and diarrhea.  I will be not taking another dose of 1.7 because despite the clear effects on my weight, I can’t let this drug ruin my life in this way!  I will see if I can go back to 1.0, since the nausea was intermittent and handled by Zofran at that level."

I took for 4 months and had no side effects until the 1.7 mg dose, but also sadly not much weight loss. My appetite was lessened, but I continually lost and gained within a 5 pound range.

The nausea was horrible and the stomach pain really bad.  Third day my husband dragged me to urgent care where I had severe dehydration.  After 4 hours of tests and 3 bags of fluid and anti-nausea drugs I was released to go home.  It's been a week since all that happened, and my stomach still is not 100%.  I'm going back to losing weight the old fashion way by smallerportions and daily walks.  I have issues with my thyroid and losing weight is very difficult, but I don't want to ever feel that awful again.  I'm glad others have had success, it's just not for me."

I have NEVER had weight issues. I started putting on weight in my mid 40's. I'm very active...I play softball a few times a week, crossfit (LOVE), 5k's and did bootcamp while doing crossfit. I'm NOT a big eater & I don't like fast food much. I eat decent but was told not enough. At lunch I always walked over a mile but I continued to ""BLOW UP""...literally! I found out I had Hashimoto disease which explained the bloating. Once Istarted my medicine for that my weight started to come off. Our drug rep came in one day with Wegovy. I asked my doctor in my office about it & was told I could try it. Me and some of the nurses started taking it. The side effects weren't to bad at first. The 3rd & 4th month was HORRIBLE! I was having IBS attacks...vomiting & #2 at the same time, tired, burping more. If I ate something...which wasn't much...if I sat down to watch tv I started feeling like I was bloating up, like I had to burp. Once I stood up I would burp & I could immediately feel the bloating going down. Then I would have attacks if I drank my protein shakes. Then I had attacks if I drank milk. I tried Almond milk & I had attacks....so I stopped drinking any form of milk. I was told by the drug rep that Wegovy doesn't do well with people that doesn't have a gallbladder...which I don't. I have lost over 20pds but I'm sure my thyroid medicine helped with that as well. I noticed since taking Wegovy I have lost some of my muscle mass which for EVERYONE is not good. You want your fat mass to go down & your muscle mass to go up. As I'm reading some of these reviews, I'm reading that some are losing a lot fast. That isn't good & it is probably muscle mass, not a lot of fat mass. 
Another side effect for me and another coworker was gag reflex. I was brushing my teeth & then tongue and I literally vomited!! NASTY!! I took my last shot this week & I'm done. I'm glad it has helped some people BUT remember to consume 85 plus grams of protein & more if you are exercising more. Drink a lot of water and do weight training!!"

Since I was a kid I have always been a hungry person and never able to go more than a few hours without eating. I typically compensated for years by extreme exercise.  After combining Covid isolation plus menopause I was obese and not feeling good. Wegovy combined with a low carb diet and exercise has made the pounds continue to fall off. I can now eat literally half or less of what I would eat normally with no stress. My brain really just tellsme now that’s enough. Thankful for science and this great advancement for weight loss!

For me it’s the  sudden nausea with bloating, constipation and fatigue.  By now, I’m learning to manage by using OTC nausea medication and stool softener. Sometimes I want to stop using it because of the symptoms, but seeing the lbs come off keeps me going.  The medication really does curb your appetite dramatically.  I don’t feel hungry at all.

My doctor and I have decided to stay at 1.7 since I’m doing so well, that way we have a backup. This past month I will say I feel like I need to titrate up, as I don’t seem to be getting full and I’m starting to think about food more. I would like to know if anyone else has noticed a decline in effectiveness. I’m still happy, plan on taking it forever if needed, with my success, it’s clear my body was depleted of this hormone. The majority of my weight came off in the first couple of months, now I’m steady, losing a pound or two occasionally, I’d be happy here, although my goal is to be 11lbs lighter. Stick with it, I had nausea up to 1.7, now it’s non-existent. Keep a bag of saltines with you, have a couple when you experience it. Highly recommend this drug."

Have lost weight and I am going to stick with it.  But after I went up to the 2.4 I started experiencing sensitive skin on my arms, legs and back.  It felt like sunburn but there was no rash, no redness.  It was very weird!  At times it was severe, especially on my back.  I actually went to my doctor thinking I had shingles.  But it has for the most part gone away.  I am still having just a small amount of sensitivity in the skin on my back.  My sister started Wegovy after me and started having the same sensitivity in her skin.  That's when we realized it must be from the Wegovy.  I have noticed my hair is dry feeling.

I am on the full maintenance dose and the weight loss seems to be leveling off.  I have not tried to lose weigh--it has just happened due to decreased appetite.  Finally something that works!  I have always had a big appetite and after menopause it really became a problem.  It seems incredible to me now that I'm not needing to eat as much.  I avoid junk foods but still have a strong sweet tooth and indulge in sweets fairly regularly.  In have had constipation, some low level nausea, some fatigue, and tingling skin at times, but not to the point of stopping Wegovy.  These side effects are mostly felt on day 2 and 3 following the injection.  By week's end they are typically gone.  Side effects also occurred when moving up to the next dose level.  But after a week at the new level the side effects dimished each time.  I lingered at .5 for two months rather than going to the next level and did the same spending two months on 1.7 because I didn't want to deal with the side effects.  Once I took the plunge and made it to 2.4, I was glad I went for it.  The first few days at 2.4 were rough but I'm okay now.  I'm about to begin my second month on the maintenance dose and am hopeful that the weight loss will continue.  I think it will because I am just not craving all the calories.  My doctor provided me a Rx for nausea, which I have only used a few times.  Also, I have continued on 10 mg of Omeprazole for acid reflux that I had taken for 5 years prior, and I did not need to increase it once I started Wegovy. I also take thyroid medication without incident.   The weight loss has really helped my arthritus knee pain,  and I feel that has been worth the trade-offs .  My doctor is pleased that the weight is coming off slowly because, she says, it is more likely to stay off that way.  I am concerned that if/when I stop taking Wegovy my appetite will return along with the weight.   But for now I am very pleased with the progress and I have no plan to stop anytime soon."

I do get body aches (like Fibromyalgia) all over until the 5th or 6th day (before I take a new shot). No nausea. I am at 1.0mg. I am debating if I should go up to the 1.7 mg. I do not like the body aching all the time. My appetite has changed for the better. I eat very small meals now. I now walk 2.5 miles a day for 4 to 5 days a week.

Not much weight loss. HOWEVER, starting the 1.7 dose yesterday... woke up this morning throwing up bile. Had heavy chest and back pain. Thought I was having a heart attack! Called paramedics. Everything checked out but I still have heavy chest and HORRIBLE reflux. I'm DONE!! The 10 lbs I have yet to lose is NOT WORTH what I'm feeling now."
Semaglutide,Wegovy,4/4/2022,G Fox,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,3,3,3,3,1,0,"I’m 54 with post menopausal weight gain. I started Wegovy in October 2021. Stop in January. Lost 25 pounds. 150 to 125. During the process, had several bouts of nausea as well as severe stomach cramping. I am on thyroid medication for hypothyroidism. Wegovy caused me to become hyperthyroid.  I was losing my hair, I was always cold and could not sleep at night. I’m not sure that losing 25 pounds was worth using Wegovy. I never made it past .50 The nausea stomach cramps and constipation were morethan I wanted to deal with. It is April 2022 and I have lost a lot of hair and my hair became very brittle and is breaking off. I do not recommend this for anyone taking thyroid medication. It is definitely going to interfere with that."

I am titrating up monthly and just took my last .5 before starting 1.0 next week. As of today (4/4/2022) I weigh 315. So almost 30 pounds in 2 months. Diet is mid-keto. Keeping carbs below 35g/day and protein above 80g/day. Have not incorporated exercise into my routine yet. I try to drink around 100+ ounces of water a day. So far no side effects on either the .25 or .50 doses other than fatigue and being constantly cold. But at 55 years of age and going through menopause, I welcome the cold. I am nervous about the higher doses, but I cannot let it bother me. I put off taking my first Wegovy injection due to fear of side effects - and that was a mistake since I haven't really had any so far. Slow and steady is best. My Doc says that anything lost on the lower doses is a bonus as most people see their best weight loss on 1.7 and 2.4 doses. Good Luck to everyone on their journey."

I started at 178 lbs and currently at 157 lbs. So I'm averaging about a lb a week. Some weeks I don't lose any weight but then the next week may lose 2-3 lbs.  I have not had any serious side effects.  Occasional nausea 1st few months but  would only lasted a few hrs. Occasional stomach cramping. I have found that when I experience these side effects it is due to forgetting to eat, eating something I shouldn't (ie: fatty or highsugar foods), or eating to much at one time.  Be sure to drink plenty of water.  I have had mild constipation issues since having my gallbladder removed just over a yr ago, so I have to occasionally take a stool softener but Wegovy hasn't seem to make it any worse. I have cervical stenosis and was having severe low back spasms. I also have some arthritis in hands and feet so I needed to get some weight off my small frame of 5'4"".  So far I'm happy with Wegovy.  I recommend not restricting your calorie intake to extremely and not trying to losing more than 1-2 lbs per week on avg (unless doctor advises otherwise). Remember to eat something every few hrs and drink plenty of water. Don't let yourself get too hungry and then eat too much, that will lead to discomfort."

I tried everything...exercise, intermittent fasting, keto, clean eating, more protein less carbs, HCG, WW, etc etc etc and the weight would not budge.  I am working with a nutritionist in my Dr's office and started a month ago at a very low dose of .25.  I am eating half of what I usually eat and have no cravings for sweets, wine or bad food.  I am down 11 lbs in 1 month and I feel hopeful for the first time in a long time!  I am less bloated and down a size.  I have nausea at times but nothing unbearable.  It basically slows your digestion down so I take something each day to help with bowel movements.  I take pepcid each day to prevent any reflux.  My injection also has B12 in it and I think it helps.  I also take a B12 shot on its own about 3 days after my Samgulitide shot.  I should also say I started bio identical hormone therapy around the same time and I think it has helped me a lot at least with the hot flashes!  I feel like my metabolism is kicking it up a notch finally!  If you can work with a reputable medical professional who has experience administering this medication, I recommend it!  I meet with mine each week and she monitors me very closely.  Dosage is key and it sounds like a lot of people start to high for some reason and that creates complications.  By the way, I started at 212.  Good luck!"

I also get bad acid reflux for those first 3 days after taking the injection.  It does help with my appetite but I struggle to have the energy to exercise.  AlthoughI will force myself to do exercise, it is not enjoyable (as it once was).  I have not had any stomach issues with the dose I have taken thus far.  And... after reading some of these other posts on here, I am nervous to up my dose for fear of severe nausea!  I really need to lose at least 30 more pounds for a knee surgery.  I have been at a plateau now for the past month, so I either need to up my dose or try another route."

I am carefully following a low calorie diet and exercising.  Not sure I am going to continue with this medication. I easily could have lost those 3 pounds the second month without this medication.  The side effects are no joke.  I am exhausted so much of the time (many days I need to nap) and have frequent GI upset, although no significant nauseau and no vomitting like others have reported. Frankly, I am really disappointed.  My doctor told me to expect to lose 8 pounds per month and that the side effects are transient and that is definitely not what is happening.  On the plus side, it is very easy to administer.  I can't imagine someone having trouble with it and I was initially nervous about self-injections.  But of course, why do injections at all when then treatment benefit seems so minimal."

I lost 20 pounds in the first two months, none the 3rd month, 2 lbs the 4th month, and 6 lbs the 5th month for a total of 28 lbs.  I have lumbar spinal stenosis, so exercise is difficult for me, but I do water walking 2-3 times per week and just started strength training twice a week.  The injections are super easy; soooo much better than a daily pill.  I wish the injector pens could be sanitized and reused instead of thrown away.  I have a hatial hernia and severe GERD.  Wegovy makes this much much worse, especially when I’m trying to sleep.  With the coupon, I pay about $1200/month as this drug is NOT covered by Anthem.  I’m a bit disappointed that I have not lost more, especially since I can eat very little without starting to feel some minor nausea. I am prediabetic, and my A1C has gone from 5.8 to 5.6.  I do think the weight loss has helped my back pain a bit, but I still need a walker to walk more than 1/4 of a mile, but I can stand up longer without as much pain as I had when I started the Wegovy."

Started out 183 pounds.  I have been on it 6 months and have lost 40 pounds! I  55 and have tried every diet out there with no results.The nausea is horrible for about 36 hours after my injection,  but eases up considerably.  I have been a little tired after each injection, but I thought I was just being lazy. Didn't realize that was a side effect. My main side effect is hair loss. I got COVID the 1st week of January and heard horrorstories of hair loss after COVID. I have noticed hair in the drain after I wash my hair and when I run my fingers through my hair. I did not realize hair loss could also be a side effect with Wegovy.  Not sure if the hair loss is from Wegovy or COVID. Seeing lots of baby hairs coming in, thank God.Overall, I really am impressed with my weight loss results with Wegovy.  Once I realized the nausea is not constant and goes away after a few days, I knew I could tolerate it. Hubby says I "" eat like a bird"". Feel full after a few bites. Learned quickly not to drink a lot of fluids and then eat. You will vomit. I learned to adjust my fluid intake around my meals. I recommended Wegovy to my sister and she is starting it soon. Interested to see how her journey on Wegovy will go. Very impressed with Wegovy and definitely recommend it for weight loss."

So at month 6 I’ve lost 36 lbs but the side effects got worse in the last two months with terrible gut pain 2-3 days after injection. When I stopped taking the medicine the pain was gone, but weight began to creep back even after maintaining the exact same amount of calories and exercise. Not sure how the medicine affected that drastic loss of weight but I did my part and at least I have better eating habits. My doctor offered to switch me to Saxenda but I’m a little uneasy about the abdominal cramping.  It’s no joke.  Hurts a lot."

I just finished my 8th week and today started on 1.0mg. I have been steadily loosing 2 pounds a week and I feel great. I can already see a difference in my body and I have more energy. The injection is truly painless and easy. Occasionally I will feel slightly nauseous but that is always because I didn’t listen to the cues my body is sending that I need to stop eating. It is hard to re-learn how you eat and listen to what your body is telling you, but if you do, you should feel fine. This medicine is a tool not a cure-all. The patient needs to also do their part and use it along with your own efforts to help on their weight loss journey"

Have lost 28lbs so far. Results were slow to come, but really started to drop weight at 1mg dose.  Nausea has definitely been the biggest issue.  My GP wrote me a script for zofran, it really helps.  Also I have absolutely NO appetite whatsoever.  I am struggling to force myself to eat, and even when I do, I am absolutely done in 2-3 bites.  I have also noticed a serious decrease in energy and overall mood- not sure if this is from not eating orthe drug itself.  But the side effects are well worth the results, for me at least.  As far as supply, there are occasional issues with getting it filled.  But I recently read the manufacturer is shut down temporarily due to safety regulations- and from what they are saying, the lower doses will be the only ones affected, and could be off the shelves for up to 6 months.  For reference, I am a 40yr old female, started in October at 201lbs, as of now (March) I’m at 172 lbs."

Had no appetite some nausea not awful. Lost 15 pounds.
Then at the 1.7 dose the bigger problems began. 
Super nausea omg I felt so ill I stayed in bed. Couldnt even talk I felt so sick. Also started to give me more muscle spasms ( I have fibromyalgia from Lyme Disease). They were nonstop and horrific. More anxiety,  could not poop at all. When I forced it and took every laxative it was so painful I wanted someone to shoot me dead.
Also..sweating. ugh.
Just awful. So I backed it down to the .5. Made it 4 weeks and after I had more anxiety again and more depression and freaked out ith a major panic attack I'm quitting forever. I don't know if it built up in my body and then caused the problems mixed with my other health conditions or what but this drug is not sustainable. I also vomited terribly on the 1.7 at 3am.
It has the most side effects with any medication I've ever tried. They were delayed, but then I got super slammed. I had to increase my anxiety med because of this.  I hope I feel better in a month. I'm disabled and don't work. I'd never be able to work while taking this drug. I'm glad some can continue.
I've felt like death since January 2022. All done with Wegovy. Lost 20 pounds but I really don't think it was worth it."
Semaglutide,Wegovy,3/17/2022,Jessica,35-44,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,4,4,5,3,1,0,"I started Wegovy 4.5 months ago and have lost 10 pounds.  I am currently on the 1.7mg dose and upping to the 2.4mg dose next week. I personally get extremely nauseous and fatigued for the first 2-3 days post injection.  The medication absolutely decreases my appetite, I get full very quickly and stay full for a long time.  I often feel quite nauseous about 20-30 mins after eating for about an hour and then it goes away.  I  read a lot of reviews that show I much greater amount of weight loss ina shorter amount of time than I have achieved and I have felt frustrated at time by that, however, the clinical trial data shows an 15% weight loss over 68 weeks, which is 17 months.  Therefore, I think my “slower” weight loss is ok and I do find the medication effective.  I am also on an SSRI for depression maintenance, which increases my appetite significantly and perhaps slows down some of the weight loss.  Before every injection, I debate if I want to stop the medication or continue it because I feel so sick the first few days, but it’s is working and I’d like to get more weight off before I stop.  In a nut shell: don’t get too frustrated if the weight is not flying off.  Watch your diet, exercise and keep going as long as you can tolerate the med."

I have my weight on and off my whole life.  I have lost 35 lbs.  I did have some of the minor side effects but nothing compared to the way it curbed my appetite and my sweet tooth and feeling full quicker.  My only complaint is I was able to buy the RX only with the use of a coupon and I got up to the 2.4 mg dosage for 1 time and the coupon had maxed out.  I can’t afford to continue with the medicine now

The doctor will not raise my dose unless I go 3 weeks with no weight loss.  She said there is no reason to titrate up, as long as it’s working, and that more side effects happen in higher doses.  I want to lose 84 pounds, and I’m down 27 pounds so far."
Semaglutide,Wegovy,3/1/2022,Make user,45-54,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,"5 weeks in I’ve lost ~10lbs with another 25lbs to go. I moved up to .5mg after the third dose of .25 and I’ll probably do the same as I titrate up to 1.0 because I’ve not had any nausea-related side effects thus far. It’s a really great drug for me. Ive tried diet and exercise several times over the years and that program worked but it was SO hard to keep it up for several months at a time and the hunger pains never went away. That’s the best thing about this drug - no hunger pains. At all. Zero. The only two things that I’ve noticed is my sleep habits became a little worse. I had trouble sleeping more than a maximum of 6 hrs / night but I started taking melatonin and that’s helped tremendously and I’m back to normal sleep. The other is a little constipation. Prior to the drug I was routine once/day, now it’s once every 3-4 days. But I eat so little now that it’s not really an issue. Aside from that I’ve had a very good experience on this drug. Nothing tastes different or worse - I just eat 1/8 to 1/10 of what I used to consume. When I eat too much, which was hard to gauge the first few weeks, I felt like I had the biggest meal of my life, which was uncomfortable, but it went away after an hour or two. You need to learn how much food is enough, which is much less than you think it is. One trick I’ve used is to try to eat very slowly."

So far, I’ve lost 40 pounds due to complete loss of appetite. I only eat lean meats, fruits, vegetables, complex carbs, low fat dairy, very little sugar, and nuts. I exercise 4-5x/wk. Zero constipation due to exercise and eating a cup of bran-type cereal each day.

I do feel tired a lot, mainly from not eating much, so keeping a food diary helps me up my food intake when it’s too low. 

I’m currently on 2.4, but I think it’s too high, so I’m going to ask my Dr.to lower it back to 1.7 next month."

I started to have intolerable side effects at the 1.7 dose and after 6 weeks had to. Drop it to .5 again.
I have fibromyalgia from Lyme disease and it gave me unbelievable fibro flares. Maybe something to do with the sugars in the muscles. I screamed in pain. Also couldn't eat much at all, was so constipated I would take anything and everything to try and go and only could after 7 hours of lying in the bathroom in the worst pain imaginable.
Woke up at 3am twice and vomited also.
I also see a difference in the texture of my hair. Very dry. Makes sense if my whole system is dry.
So I'm using the .5 maybe 2x month but I think I'm going off it. I just got my hair back and I don't want to lose it again.
I don't know how many can tolerate the side effects at the higher doses. I was so nauseous I felt like death.
I'll try my best to keep the weight off.
Maybe a low bimonthly dose will help me do that. I am 53 years old. The website wouldn't let me record my real age.
Good luck"

I exercise a lot, but haven't changed what I eat much. The pros... I can feel starving, then be full after eating very little. I'm losing weight pretty consistently. I can still eat things like sushi, ice cream etc, but instead of eating a bunch, a few bites and I feel satisfied. Food I used to love I no longer have any craving for. I have also noticed that even drinking (in a margarita fan) has lost a lot of its allure. I amlooking great and about to break the 150 mark for the first time in a decade.

Cons... I feel generally unwell. Like I am coming down with something. It wasn't terrible at first, but as the dose increases, it gets pretty bad. I am on a generic semaglutide so thank God, the prescriber has been able to titrate me insanely slow (often by .25 every week or two) but we had to lower it back again as I seriously was miserable. Since getting to around 1.7, I am having a lot of problems with constipation, way more nausea (like waking at 4am and running to the bathroom to vomit), heartburn, and lots of burping which randomly started this week and really sucks. I exercise about 6 days a week and went from level 8-10 on the elliptical to feeling like I'm going to pass out of I go higher than about level 2. A flight of stairs kicks my butt. I get dizzy super easy. Most of this slowly started around 1mg, but the 1.7 has been brutal. I told the prescriber I don't think I can go higher than this and she seems amenable. So I imagine the weight loss will slow down but it would be nice to find a balance of still maintaining/losing a bit while also feeling well."

Exercise, drinking nothing but water, coffee, taking  laxatives, prune juice, fiber supplements, probiotics, & enema didn't work & now I'm having 2 see a gastrologist.

My side effects have been pretty mild. I think I had nausea/stomach pain the first few weeks after I started. Now for the most part I only have nausea in the few days after I've titrated up. I did have one week where I started puking and had really bad nausea. It turned out I'd forgotten to take my dose the week before. I'm writing the date I'm supposed to take each on the shots right when I get a new box now. My appetite has been reduced significantly. Some days I can eat normal amounts of food, but others I just don't get hungry or get full very quickly. I am very aware of when I'm full now, like I'll eat half of my food and then feel like I don't want another bite. If for some reason I do eat past that point I can get nauseous and my stomach might start hurting, but that's rare for me. Also the shots themselves aren't that bad. I do Emgality shots once a month and those hurt a lot more than the Wegovy. My weight loss has been really steady. I don't think I'm done losing weight and the weight loss has been pretty unrelated to my exercise/types of food I eat. I've been stressed and have not been making good decisions in those areas. I'll probably stay on this for the rest of my life if I can. As far as the cost, I get it for $25 with the coupon for now. I was told it would be $100 a month without the coupon. I luckily just got a better job, so I'm just going to pay the $100 a month once the coupon runs out. Hopefully insurances will start covering it more and make it more accessible."

From Day 2 
I did not Crave food. I did not think about my next meal
I did not feel the hunger one feels when they are obese. You know what I mean
I have gone every morning but two without breakfast. Yes I know its the most important meal. But its also a chance for your body to start burning fat. I dont care what nutritionist say it worked for me in the past. And if I can only have coffee until 1130a I am doing this.

I have lost 65 lbs since August 1, 2021 with minimal side effects. My favorite part of taking Wegovy is that it has changed the way I think about food. For me, the challenge and struggle in losing weight is that I constantly thought about what I was or wasn't eating. Wegovy has changed that. I rarely have cravings. If I do, a small bite of something satisfies the craving. Thankfully, my insurance has approved it through Aug 2022. Hopefully, I will be able toget it for my cost of $25/month after then. I hope that insurance agencies will see the value in approving weight loss medication for prevention of comorbidities of obesity."

Sure it works, anyone would lose weight if they’re constantly sick. It’s like a forced eating disorder because if you eat more than a few bites you’ll vomit and then eventually you lose your appetite completely. Constantly nausea for 4 months  will do that to you. It did solve a problem for me in getting a large amount of weight off, 40 lbs in 4 months to be exact. Due to a health issue (diagnosis of RA) I suddenly gained a lot of weight and couldn’t getit back off. I’m not sure that this would work for someone who’s been overweight for an extended period of time for the sheer fact that you don’t learn any healthy habits so I’m not sure how you would maintain it once discontinuing Wegovy. I’m not even sure i won’t gain it back for the same reason. Not eating is not healthy, vomiting every week is not healthy and is it really safe to mess with your blood sugar and pancreas? I’m grateful for getting this head start and hope that I can now move to (my own) phase two and work with a nutritionist because I just can’t do it anymore. Bottom line it may have some benefits for some people but there are a lot of side effects so proceed with caution. Words just could not express how incredibly sick I have been since starting this!

She also provided an anti-nausea medication that helps just a little.  Very torn because I want to keep losing but I also want to stop feeling sick every single day. My husband thinks this is ridiculous and I should stop because he is tired of me being sick.  In my third month I also started experiencing headaches and they continue.

Taking a 3 week break right night.
Maybe I'll go to the bathroom. Also people...if you lose weight too fast your hair will cone out. Careful. I list 16 pounds in 4 months and I'm worried because I just regrew my hair from my illness. Be careful. Tirate SLOWLY

I get very tired initially and the mild headache along with acid reflex can be annoying but the results have been worth it. I feel less interested in eating, even if my favorite food is around I’m just not getting the same satisfaction from it that I did in the past. 

I haven’t been great about exercising but I’ve still been losing 2-3 (sometimes more) lbs a week. I’m definitely an advocate for this shot if other procedures and plans haven’t worked for you."

So now I'm worried that the 1 mg dose isn't working. It was the .5 mgs where I lost the most weight but was the sickest. Do I need to go back down to .5? Should I just keep going? Not sure what to do but this drug is amazing and I would highly recommend. Not everybody will experience the same side effects, so don't let that keep you from trying it. My nausea wasn't that bad and Wegovy has never caused me to vomit. Oh and I'm a female, 45 y/o and 5'3""."

I’ve had it happen after 3 out of 4 injections now, and it’s very disheartening.  According to the pharmacist, this is extremely common with these  pens— up to 45% of the time.  Wouldn’t the medication work better if you were getting the FULL DOSE each time?  I’ve lost 10#, so I must be getting a little of it.  I’m an RN with 45 years of experience, and this is a less than perfect  injection system.  And watching the medicine roll down your leg or abdomen is like watching $400 run down the drain.

So far I have lost 25 lbs, which has been wonderful. My biggest issues are the nausea and constipation. I have increased my water intake which has helped a bit, but the nausea is unreal. I am on the 1.0 dose and I can't imagine getting to the higher dose. It is definitely a mental adjustment to not being able to eat as much, or as mindlessly. I am hoping Zofran will help with the nausea."

Semaglutide,Wegovy,12/21/2021,Anonymous,35-44,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,I'm on my 4th month of treatment (one more week left) and have made it to the 1.7mg dose. Early on i started noticing constipation but that was an easy fix. Just making sure I eat more fiber and using a stool softener. There would be a few times I felt nauseous but i wasn't eating like i should have. Just trying to learn what my body needed. That went away with some adjustments to snacking and eating. This new dose however has been the hardest for me. The nausea is lingering. There have been a few times that I actually throw up. The nausea usually lasts the first two days of the weekly shot. If I take a nausea pill though it really helps. I notice that I feel full all day long some days. I try to eat something small just knowing that I still need to eat. I don't have any cravings. I've lost around 30 pounds. It started slowly at first but has really increased over the last 4 weeks. I've noticed that many of my clothes are fitting better. With more exercise I think my results will be even better. If you can find ways to manage any negative side affects I think its worth it to stick it out.
Semaglutide,Wegovy,12/21/2021,TO SAVE A LIFE,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for Overweight Person with BMI 27 to 29 and Weight-Related Comorbidity,5,5,5,5,1,0,I started this journey July 9th as a last resort to get healthy enough to come off of blood pressure medicine.  My brother is my best friend and is in need of a kidney transplant. His time if running short.  I am his only full blooded sibling. I went to Tampa to find out how to test to see if I was a match. I was turned away due to being under the age of 50 and on blood pressure meds which make me high risk for kidney problems in the future.  I was told I need to be off blood pressure meds at least 90 days before they will even test me to see if I am in fact a match.  I was devastated. When I returned home I spoke to my cardiologist and he told me to limit salt and lets try to lose some weight and he will monitor my blood pressure and see what we can do to come off the meds.  I went the very next day to a weight loss doctor and discussed options.  We determined that due to the nature of medical needs surrounding my need for regaining my health we would go with the wegovy.  As of December 20th I am down 34lb and about 8 inches off my waist.  I have been monitoring my blood pressure and taking half the medicine strength now from what I was on.  My blood pressure sometimes runs a little low/normal so we are thinking within another month or so I will be able to go without it and see how I do.  If everything goes well I hope to be able to enroll in testing to see if I am a match to donate a kidney for my brother.  If I am a match then we owe it to wegovy for saving two lives not just one.  That is a blessing for sure.  Fingers crossed and prayers raised.

At first I just had mild nausea and great appetite suppression, but the last month I have bad nausea/pain episodes about once a week.  Its bad enough that I am stopping the wegovy, even though I am terrified of gaining weight back.  Still, I feel this medication is worth a try by anyone who is overweight or obese."

A little blah and had to take extra Pepcid for unset stomach. First day was amusing. Stomach gurgled nonstop all day. That night a little nauseous. Totally shut down my desire to eat. Certain food taste different. Sweet thing tend to taste overly sweet. Feeling full much sooner and can’t get through a full meal.  This is certainly the strangest drug I've ever taken. I’m hoping for the best. The doctor said she has had no one drop out.

I’m not sure that I will be able to continue taking this medication. While my cravings have been diminished significantly, I simply cannot eat without extreme nausea even with an anti-nausea medication. Within an hour of the shot, my arm and neck on the side I had the shot felt like they were sunburnt. Within 4 hours, I was vomiting more violently than I did while pregnant. I’ve never been this I’ll feeling since the time I had food poisoning and ended uphospitalized. The nausea is pervasive and will not go away even after vomiting and zofran. I’ve lost 7 pounds in 48 hours. Feel like I’m drying up. Smells trigger the nausea, even on day 3. It’s also given me some severe headaches that begin in the evenings and continue for many hours until I managed to fall asleep. I have nasty sulphuric burps and the gas and bloating are pretty bad too. Just started with diarrhea this morning. Not sure what it did to my system, but I’m not sure that I want to see what a higher dose does to my body. I doubt that I will continue this medication beyond the second dose unless my side effects improve dramatically."

The only bad thing is that I stay nauseous all the time, and the next 2 days after taking the injection, I would throw up, even if I haven't ate anything, I would throw up the wegovy medicine I think, because it would be yellowish stuff coming up, and it has a weird taste. But on the 3rd day, and after, I just be nauseous, and I can't really eat anything, and if I eat to much, I would throw it up.

I started the highest level of Wegovy 10 days ago - 2.4 mg.  I almost immediately developed a skin sensitivity on my back.  Not itchy, no rash but just felt like I had a sunburn.  Honestly, I thought it was the starch in the shirt I had on.  It has remained for the past 10 days.  A few days after that started, I noticed that I had no hair on my legs - none at all.  None on my arms or underarms.  Honestly, I cannot pinpoint the day I noticed this development, but it was definitely noticeable after I hit the highest dosage.  I was freaked out - super concerned I would lose the hair on my head which at the moment, does not look any thinner.  I just got back from a dermatologist this morning and brought all the prescriptions I take.  When I pulled out the Wegovy box, he exclaimed, ""that is so interesting.  I got two calls from PCPs last week that said their patients on Wegovy had small bald spots on their scalp.""  He didn't know what dosage they were on.  He said he is going to contact the manufacturer to report these reported side effects.  He looked at my legs under a special magnifying glass.   He said that the hair follicles were not scarred - the hair was visible but not above the surface.  This would seem to indicate it will grow back.  He looked at my scalp and said it was healthy so, not thinning at the moment.  JUST A WARNING TO ALL."

I tired drinking green tea and not even 20 minutes later I had to throw it up . Had some madeleines vomit aswell. I looked up and realized the side effects are what I’m having but it hit me so hard this morning that I had to call into work because I didn’t want them thinking I had covid symptoms and send me home . 

Fingers crossed I get over this little rough patch because I wanna be able to try this new adventure because I’ve had trouble losing weight for years ."

I have had minimal side effects including nausea and constipation. Some diarrhea as well on and off. However, I have stuck to it and lost 43 pounds which has improved my health and self esteem. I would and have recommended it to many friends and coworkers. It got started when the coupon offer was available however it has since gone away. I am concerned when I stop in a few weeks. It has really helped to keep my appetite reduced. I have learned to eat less but I don’t want to gain the weight back."

I started at .25 for a month and am on .5 for one and a half months and was nauseous for a month. I found taking the shot at night has helped with that. I have lost 12 pounds and It curbs my appetite like nothing else has, I no longer crave sweets or snacks; I am not waking up in the middle of the night to get a snack which been amazing!

I'm currently on 1.7 doses for this month. I've not changed anything in my lifestyle.  I will say that Wegovy helps me crave only nutritious foods and drinks.  It's totally changed my taste buds.  What that means is some foods/drinks i used to enjoy, i no longer crave and in fact, I now dislike them.  No more coffee for me at all.  No more sweets, chocolates, etc.  I seriously had an addiction to chocolate kisses and now justthe sight of them makes me slightly nauseous. I don't really exercise either, so like I said my weight loss is all Wegovy.  I have a minor side effect of nausea but it's mostly when i wake up in the morning.  How can anyone complain with these kind of results? I love Wegovy!  Happy weight loss everyone!"

However, those that are using this or considering using this need to understand just that, it is only a tool. Wegovy has allowed me to feel fuller almost every single day, without eating 1/2 of what I put on my plate. I am on my 2nd dose of .5 (about 6 weeks) and have lost 18 lbs. I do a lot of cardio, but I also love the gym. I feel nauseous if I eat too much or too much of something with too much sugar or fat. I feel this is teaching me how to eat better.

Some negative side effects I've been experiencing are:

Yes it has been difficulty to get the dose of medication from pharmacies when you need it but my pharmacist has been great about looking around and getting it to me in time for increase. However when i increased to 1mg my body could not handle it , I became nervous on the inside and not eating hardly any food. The taste of most foods I love and have been eating  for years no longer taste the same therefore I don't have a taste for anything so my provider switch me back down to the 0.5 and I'm am doing great.

I have a couple of cartridges containing .5 or just 1mg.

Semaglutide,Wegovy,10/26/2021,Shelly,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,"Just completed my 12th week injection and I’m down 32 lbs so far! I spent one month at .25 and two at .5. Moving up to 1mg next week. Did experience bad nausea for a while, so my Dr prescribed Zofran and I take one pill before the injection and I don’t have any issues now. Definitely cuts my hunger/cravings way down. I focus on eating clean/lean proteins, fruit/veg, dairy (Greek yogurt) and very few grains. I’m diligent about checking labels and learned early on not to cheat. This medication will let you know fast if it doesn’t like something you ate and you won’t forget.  Been working with a Dietitian and she really helped me with making smart food choices. Exercising one day a week with a trainer and hoping to increase that soon. Weighing myself daily which has really helped.  I can tell how my body responds to any new foods this way. I first tried getting the medication at CVS and Walgreens and they weren’t able to get it. My local CVS still can’t (asked them recently). I use an independent local pharmacy now and they have no issues getting it. Go figure. Briefly used the coupon code, which was great, but my insurance has authorized paying for it, so that’s even easier.  If you are committed to eating properly/exercising I would definitely recommend Wegovy."

I give the shot in my left arm since I have a phobia of sticking a needle in my stomach or leg.  The arm is so easy and it doesn’t hurt.  I would recommend this for sure.  The more you work out or walk, the better the results!"

No side effects, no weight gain or loss. Then had to wait 3 weeks to get the refill for the next dose of 0.5. I just took the first dose of it 4 days ago and I haven't been able to keep anything down at all. I eat a little bit and 20 minutes later it all comes up. I can't keep going like this. It is severe projectile vomiting. On the bright side, I did lose 3 pounds, but i don't want to lose it like this. My throat burns from vomiting so much, I've had amigraine, and I'm afraid to eat anything and i don't know how long it'll take for this medication to leave my body."

How can it be easy to use when availability is inconsistent.  It has been a struggle to get prescription filled every month with it taking 4 weeks before first prescription filled after moving prescription to several pharmacies.  Now after dose 8 I’m faced with 7 weeks before dose 1.0 is available on October 31. Does stopping the progression of doses raise flags of concern for the anybody but me?  Lost about 7 lbs.  Good appetite suppressant.  Sweets are too sweet.  Definite side effect of messing with my mind and moods. I’m wondering if stopping wegovy cold turkey is going to cause more of these unwanted side effects.

I'm due for the higher dose next week and I'm hoping that the side effects remain tolerable. The needle itself is small, for those of you wondering it's like anepi-pen, slight sting but that's it."

I have lost 7lbs and 30 inches all over. This has definitely cut back my appetite and sometimes I have to remind myself to eat. I am also eating much less at meals so I made up snack boxes this week to make sure I eat a healthy snack that is low calorie. The only problem I have found is eggs taste and smell funny to me. I have asked my family if they noticed eggs tasting funny and they said no so I know it's me with this medication. I also noticed that thesmell I get with eggs is now stuck in my nose. It's like a sulfur smell. Overall this medication is working and very easy to use. I do the injection in my thighs just switch each week.

Hunger diminished, exercising regularly, riding my bike daily.  Week 5 I started .5 and that's where this story unfortunately will end.   I cannot explain how sick I am.    I've had a hiatal hernia which is dormant for 20 or more years, I take nexium daily.   It's I describable how sick I've been.   Vomiting, diarrhea, sulphur burps, queasy stomach, feels like a brick is on my sternum.    Cannot lie down, burning bile backs up.   Today would have been my sixth shot, second st.5.  Instead of taking it, I'm googling how long it will take for this stuff to leave my system.    My diet is very low calorie, 500 or under, with that and exercise, I lost 11 lbs over five weeks.  After the horrific reaction, three lbs more came off but that's because of artificial weight loss although I would have lost a bet if I'd have bet no human being can expell that much material in one day.  I've never been this sick.  E VER.   So I'm going to stop now because I think the lesson is beware if you have a hiatal hernia.   It definitely was effective but I know it had very bad consequences for me. Nothing helped.   I found myself searching my cabinets for leftover Zantac, that's how much I just wanted to disappear.    Cannot lie down, aches everywhere.   Bye bye for me"

I have been eating low calorie since then which has been easy to do because my appetite has decreased dramatically! I am super surprised because today I am down 5.4lbs!

However I had gastric bypass a few years back so my stomach is always off. Yet this didn’t make it any worse. Has taken urges away to snack and really simply eat. I don’t feel terribly full yet could be because I have a small stomach to begin with and I eat small meals to begin with. First week only threw up once. Second week no issues and now into my third week. I am disappointed in the weight loss so far in 18days only lost 4.4 pounds and that is eating average 600 calories per day, keeping carbs under 80 per day and working out 3-4x per week. I was truly hoping for a jump in my weight loss.  I feel ready to move onto 1.0 after my 4th shot.  the shot itself I don’t even feel it I jsur feel the pressure of the pen kn my thigh which I recommend upper thigh. as for the benefits I cannot see. I am barely pre diabetic 5.7 A1c and this medicine hasn’t caused me to have low blood sugar that I can tell, even with keeping to under 80g carbs per say. So I hope this is helping my pancreas and getting me out of the ore diabetic zone for good. My insurance doesn’t cover and I have the discount savings card from Novo for six months which I understand they stopped for anyone new after 8-16 but I am able to get 5 more month supplies. There is a shortage and I had to call around and luckily found a pharmacy a bit far to fill my 1.0 box. More to follow when i move onto 1.0"

I have lost about 7 lbs and quite happy with those results. The first day of injection has been the worse for me accompanied with an annoying headache. I sometimes felt mild acid reflux and nausea that I normally calm with a soda and crackers. I endure dry mouth along with an irritating bitter or nasty taste in my mouth. Other times, I just feel off kilter and can't identify a specific symptom. But I am really concerned about my fatigue which I feltmore the second week.  I noticed only a few people mentioned that side affect. My appetite has largely diminished. (Actually, the joy of craving a particular food and satisfying that craving is done). When I do, eat pretty much anything will do. With busy 12 hour work days, I often don't eat at all. I conclude that may be attributing to the lethargy. I have succumbed to drinking pedialyte regularly and intend on drinking more water. I am getting through the day OK but can't wait to lie down when I get home (unusual for me). A few co-workers have commented on my lack of energy and luster, so to speak.  Perhaps Week 3 will be better.  I'm fighting to endure the ""cons"" for the desired result.  I get married in November and would love to be about 30-40 lbs lighter for the wedding. If I happen to reach that goal, I will probably refrain from taking it and work hard to keep the weight off."

So far I’ve lost 11 lbs with no exercise. The needle is very small and I can hardly feel it. I’m injecting into my thigh. Pros: I’m not hungry at all so I have to force myself to eat. When I do eat I eat very little. Cons: I get really nauseated especially on day of injection and day after. The other days are more tolerable. Every now and then I experience some heartburn which subsides with over the counter meds. All in all the drug is working! I can deal with the minor side effects as long as I’m getting great results.

I've lost 10lbs. Have cut back my food craving and amount I eat.  Took 2nd week of .5mg was fine for about 6 hour and then I started having nausea, dizziness,fatigue, vomiting, headache, low blood sugar, fast heart rate and insomnia. I will not be taking the medication again. As much as I need help with weight loss it is not worth it. I have been in bed for 3 days and does not seem to be getting any better."

I have had not much side effects, but haven't lost any weight either.  I am unsure if this is really going to do anything.  Maybe going to the 0.5 will be more effective?  I would love to know if anyone has had the same experience as me ?"
Semaglutide,Wegovy,8/3/2021,TLavin,45-54,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,2,0,"I'm on day 3  of .5mg and so far I'm very pleased with the results - I'm already down 7 pounds. The main side effect I've had is extreme moodiness, and other lesser side effects are malaise, gassy/bloating and light-headedness. I think the biggest issue I'll have on this medication is eating enough. I have set a timer to eat every two hours a really small snack because I'm just not hungry whatsoever! I will definitely keep posting my feedback and results. I feel very hopeful because I've tried everything to lose weight and absolutely nothing has worked. Thank you."

I’ve been taking this for 2 1/2 weeks. Definitely have some constipation and bloating so that has been slightly uncomfortable. No cravings for sweets which was my biggest issue before starting Wegovy. Struggling to eat enough calories. I’ve been like that for the last several years but prior to Wegovy it was always carbs and sweets. I’ve only lost 2 lbs so far so I’m beginning to wonder if it’s even going to work for me ??
Semaglutide,Wegovy,7/27/2021,DLH,35-44,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,4,4,5,3,2,0,"Only my first week. Nausea/vomiting has been difficult. Recommend asking your Dr for nausea meds. Headache only first couple days. And fatigue. Recommend liquid/soft diet first week to help pass nausea and help constipation. Also, SMALL PORTIONS. Shot is easy peasy, no pain! It will take getting used to and figuring out how/what to eat to reduce symptoms. I've lost 10lbs in 6 days. DRINK LOTS OF WATER!! If you're serious about losing weight, the side affects are manageable."

I didn't even feel the shot at all, I put it in my upper left thigh- where I dont have much feeling anyway. I did get a slight headache later in the day, but nothing else. I woke up this morning w very little uneasiness to my stomach but it quickly went away. I was expecting the worst so this has been a blessing! I did youtube another person who is taking it and she was the same way and then the upped dosage next in line kicked her butt. I hope that isnt the case for me. I am down 5lbs since I started it, 3 of which happened overnight."
Semaglutide,Wegovy,7/26/2021,Cindy,55-64,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,2,0,I took my 2nd injection 3 days ago and so far so good.  My doctor prescribed an anti-nausea medication but I really haven't needed it.  The only side effect so far is constipation. The injection is extremely easy to take and not a bit painful (read the instructions or watch the video on how to give yourself the injection).  My appetite has been greatly reduced on just the smallest dose.  I don't have the cravings for sugar that I had before.  I've lost 4.3 lbs in only 10 days.  I'm hoping to lose 30 lbs overall so this is a great start.

Only side effect is mild nausea a few hours after injection, but no vomiting and it subsides fairly quickly. Makes me thirsty, I drink more water. My appetite is WAY less now and i eat way less, also. Not craving sweets or carbs. Absolute BEST weight loss medication on the market today! Preventative for weight related comorbidities such as diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, etc. The price is way too expensive, but hopefully over time it can beless than $100/mo. With the promotional discount card, it's $25/mo for 6 months max. Without insurance Wegovy and Saxenda are around $1400/mo, ridiculous prices."

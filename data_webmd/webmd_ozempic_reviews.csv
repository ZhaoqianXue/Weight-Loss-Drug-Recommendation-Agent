The acid reflux was so bad it was trying to push the food back up again as I was trying to swallow. This stuff is terrible. I only took 2 injections then told my doctor that I flat out refuse to use anymore of this crap. Horrible experience.

I had many tests done by my GP, gyno and rheumatologist. Nothing. Then my NP put me on Semaglutide and my body is back to normal! I have energy and no more body stiffness issues at all within days of starting it. It’s a miracle! I have also lost 15 lbs in 3 lbs which is nice. But I don’t really need to lose much more. I hope I can stay on a lower dose to avoid going back to my issues. Only problem I’ve had is constipation. ButI takes prunes, Miralax and Emma capsules and that is helping a lot. Anyway, I wanted to share my story in case it helps others."

I was absolutely losing weight! I gave myself shots for around a year. About month 6, I landed in the hospital with extreme dizziness to the point that I couldn't stand to move. When I say extreme, I mean, it was like I was being swung around by my foot and tossed into outer space where there's no gravity and I was spinning every direction. I landed in the hospital twice. Once I had intestinal pain with diarrhea and bleeding. At the hospital they found that I had something going on with my intestine, directly where I had given myself the shot. Stopped using my stomach and started giving my shots only in my thighs. However, the dizziness continued to come back. The ER Dr. sent me to a neurologist and what they told me was I had BPPV. Being that I had never had this issue before, I just didn't see how it just started happening out of the blue. I tried ear canalith repositioning as per the neurologist instruction when I had the episodes. Unfortunately, when it happened I would be unable to function for a week at a time before it would subside. Then it started happening more regular. I stopped taking the Ozympic and reported it to my Dr. Never again!"

My 36 year old son was prescribed Ozempic by his doctor. My son was only slightly overweight but was hoping to shed a few pounds. After 3 months of use, he'd become lethargic, depressive, and was having suicidal thoughts, emotions he'd never previously experienced. He stopped taking Ozempic, but a month later ended his life by suicide. Our family, needless to say, is heartbroken over the loss of our wonderful son, brother, husband, and father.

Semaglutide,Ozempic,9/8/2024,Joanna,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5,5,5,5,1,0,It's very effective from the beginning and in addition helped me to loose a lot of weight (50lbs in 3 months).
Semaglutide,Ozempic,8/27/2024,Notquitesureyet,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,3.6666666666666665,3,4,4,1,0,"I’m 63 and was diagnosed with T2 diabetes 2-1/2 years ago. I immediately went on the carnivore diet and lost 25#, and lowered my A1C from 6.8 to 6 and lowered my triglycerides from 333 to 98. I had more energy and felt decent with exception to joint pain from arthritis. 

I didn’t want to live this way indefinitely so I  transitioned to keto and then back to eating like a normal person and  slowly started gaining the wait back on. I gained 20lbs back on. 

My dietician told me that keto is the worst diet for diabetics and informed me that I should be eating 150g carbs every day. I don’t understand this at all because my BS is good when I eat less carbs and I don’t normally eat that many carbs in a day normally anyway. Not to mention you’re not going to eat that many on Ozempic anyway. Whatever…

My A1C crept back up to 6.8 so doctor suggested Ozempic. This is the only medication I take. 

I’ve been on Oz since mid May and I continue to have the same symptoms plus more as I have titrated my dose up to 1mg.

 My negative symptoms are nausea, fatigue,  constipation, feeling “off”, and for the first time woke up in the night feeling like I would vomit so was cuddling the toilet for awhile until it subsided and came out the other end. Not diarrhea either, very hard ?? and crampy. Sorry for the TMI. 
The severe constipation concerns me the most because I wonder if it’s making me feel ill (toxic?)and could lead to a blockage. I started taking miralax to help so we will see if it helps. 

I wanted to note some positive side effects that I’m noticing too. I have rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, I have had Lyme disease that has damaged my joints so I’ve dealt with a lot of inflammation for over 20 years but since taking Oz my inflammation has significantly reduced. My face and hands are no longer puffy. So this has been a pleasant surprise. 

My appetite is half of what it used to be and the longer I’m on 1mg(this is my second month in 1mg) I’m finally noticing that food noise quieting down. 

I’m also down about 12-13lbs. I would like to lose 20-25 more and I’m ok if it comes off slowly. I’ll admit that initially I was irritated that I wasn’t losing as fast as some have. But I’m severely insulin resistant (according to my doctor) so l should expect a slower loss. 

Some days I wonder if it’s worth the fatigue, constipation and feeling off every but some of your reviews have given me hope that in time these symptoms will subside. I’m thankful that my doctor isn’t titrating my dose up too fast either. I did .25 for one month, then a month at .5 and now  I’ll be on 1 mg for at least 3 months."

Horrible sour stomach burping, bloated. Fourth week I ended up in the hospital ER with nausea and vomiting that  would not stop, a bladder infection, severe stomach cramps and severe dehydration. They gave me a huge dose of anti nausea meds and an iv and did acat scan. Prior to hospital visit, I had zero appetite, but I did not lose weight either!

I was on Trulicity for a year with the most awful digestive side effects including days and days of not being able to eat, constant pain and nausea.

Ozempic is A TOTALLY different experience. I'm on month 3.The injections are painless and easy. I've had next to no side effects until just the last few days and I don't even know if it's the Ozempic that's causing them. I have gastroparesis for years and it's comes and goes at times. It's been really annoying this past week and I hope it is unrelated to the Ozempic as we are moving me up to the higher dose next week. I cannot say if I've lost any weight but that's ok bc I lost so much with Trulicity and it's been delightful to actually be able to eat.

The best part is, my A1C is 5.0 and my average daily blood sugar is around 95."

 I Started this journey in May.  It took time to get labs.  They weren't totally forth coming about the Ulta Labs and fees. Which was my 1 ??.  Then once I was finally approved  The man I spoke with Siad I was approved for the highest dosage 2.5mgs.  I was told to start with ""units"" the 1st week, then up it 10 the 2nd week & then up/down 5 units each week until I get to where I need to be.  I finally received the medication  2nd ??is when the syringes come and are 1cc syringes and only marked by 10 increments called ""units"" and the vial doesn't hold 2.5 mgs.  When I email the man that I was working with on the phone with questions like what is the unit considered to be, how long before I get to 2.5 mgs, and why I was told it was  5 weeks worth of medication but the vial says to discard any medication 28 days after the initial puncture.  I never received a response so that to me was another ??.  So I called person wouldn't answer questions and was transferring me to a supervisor and the call dropped.  So I made several calls and finally got a different supervisor who explained 1 unit so each increment of 10 on syringe is .25 so at that rate it will take months to get up to 2.5.  This is a big ??as so many reviews of various companies say this is how they take your $$ & you don't see the weight loss because the dose is so low.  I feel like I've been deceived as I was told on my initial phone call of being approved that I would be given 2.5mg within 4 weeks.  The supervisor also told me to disregard the label that says to discard medication after 28 days from initial puncture. This is another ??to me because why would they put it on the bottle if they didn't feel it was necessary?   Would you be concerned?  Has anyone else experienced this?  I'm left here totally confused. I thought I was finally getting help for my weight issues but it feels like someone failed to be open and honest with me from the start. So I'm not sure what to do at this point.   Do I continue and see how it works or switch to another provider and start all over?  I hate to start over but I'm concerned with transparency.  I'd appreciate any recommendations!  I want to like the company but I feel like something is off. I was told 2.5mg but that is months away.  I know from the research that it is less effective and even ineffective at such low doses such as .5 so why would they start me at .25 and increase it at 5 units after the 2nd week. ?  I'm really confused and discouraged.  I wish I could attach photos of the vial and syringes."

I pay $365 for a two month supply thru my doctors office. After my first dose I lost 7lbs in 5 days and then I have been constipated for the past 3 days. I did not have any other side effects and for my 2nd dose I did 15ml instead of 10ml. I look forward to losing at least 30lbs in a month. Please understand I did change my eating habits. I have a protein shake for breakfast, Chicken wrap for lunch and chili or another protein shake for dinner. I walk at least 2 miles a day, one mile in the morning and another at night. As far as I'm concerned I will not spend money on something and still drink sodas, eating chips and other junk expecting the medicine to make the processed foods not sabotage myself by eating everything and anything under the sun.  This medicine however did not suppress my appetite to the point that I wasn't even hungry. It just assisted me in my weight loss journey. After my initial dose I did eat candy and still lost that weight. I wonder if I haven't would I have lost more? I stopped the junk food 2 days after my first dose. The negative reviews that are here, I wonder if you all are just eating and drinking junk and expecting this drug to be a magical fix that allows you have your cake and eat it too.  literally and figuratively!!!!!!"

I went on to further my education and am becoming a therapist myself because i thought becoming an expert would enanle me to get out of these cycles. Sure, ive learned alot but the physical aspect of hungeris hard. Also, I am pre-diabetic. The hunger urges and feelings associated with low blood sugar (even though I never read low) always do me in and I end up failing. Unfortunately, even pre-diabetic and with a BMI of 43, my insurance wouldn't cover gastric bypass. I lost, gained back, and lost again the same 30ish lbs multiple times over the past 5 years. After this last loss, I could feel myself wanting to quit and getting into a dark place of thinking, I'm never going to be able to maintain, so whats the point? Against my dietician's advice, I chose to try semaglutide through a local clinic at $500/month, out of pocket because, again, my insurance wouldn't cover it. After 7 months, I am down 43 lbs and am the lowest weight I've been since I had my 3rd child 13 years ago. More importantly, it has given me freedom from the constant obsessing over counting calories, macros, picking my diet plan, and weighing myself. I have never in my life felt ""normal"" around food before this. For the first time in my life I can walk away from food and not care. The weight loss has been very slow, which hurts given the cost of the medication. But, I truly feel free on it, and i feel like i can't put a price tag on that. While it has been ""life changing"" it only does part of the job.  I've had to choose to exercise, make healthy food choices, and be more overall active and health conscious. This just made it possible to start and maintain those habits. In the beginning months, I had some nausea, but I could live with it because I before I would often restrict and then binge until i was sick, so the type of nausea didn't make much of a difference. The worst part has been the constipation. I've had chronic bloat and diarrhea since I was a child. I thought constipation would be a reprieve, but really just a different variety of evil. I'm on maintenance now, so a shot every 2 weeks instead of weekly. I can tell when it wears off because my bowel habits go back to (my) normal and I'm hungrier. I have to work to keep the habits I've established. I also chose to switch to a whole food plant based diet a month ago which keeps me away from trigger foods (like cakes, donuts, muffins, and fast food.) I think this is also helping me to continue to lose .25-.5 lb/wk. Overall, I would recommend this to people who've struggled like I have. I'm 5'5"". My highest weight was 263. Starting on this med was 236. Currently 193."

Semaglutide,Ozempic,10/18/2023,DontBeScared,45-54,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5,5,5,5,1,0,"Just wanted to share my Ozempic journey with you all. I've recently started on my fourth round of Ozempic, this tiny 0.25 dosage. Honestly, admitting that I have diabetes still feels weird, but hey, here I am.

I used to be on Metformin (500 mg) for a solid two years, and it was great until it suddenly stopped working. No matter how well I ate, my sugar levels were sky-high after meals, often hitting the 200s or 300s. If you're dealing with type 2, you know how awful that feels.

I made it clearto my doc that I didn't want insulin. I was open to any other solution, be it a diet change, lifestyle tweak, or new meds. When Metformin lost its charm, my doc suggested Ozempic. With my blood sugar all over the place, and being a 53-year-old, 6'1"", 260-pound guy, I was game to try anything.

I'll admit, I was a bit of a chicken about starting Ozempic. I read tons of reviews, and that didn't help my nerves. The pen sat in my fridge for two weeks until one day, my sugar spiked to 450 after having a small piece of sourdough bread with chicken soup. That was my breaking point. I finally jabbed the Ozempic into my thigh and went to bed.

The next day started fine, but I felt sicker than ever. Zero appetite. Weirdly, Diet Dr Pepper was the only thing that didn't make me want to puke. By day two, I was feeling better. The sickness faded, and it hasn't come back since. My appetite is practically nonexistent now. I mostly survive on different versions of chicken soup and the occasional handful of nuts. And don't worry, my evening White Claws survived the Ozempic invasion.

But here's the kicker – my blood sugar levels normalized within a week, maybe a bit too low at times. After years of dealing with crazy high sugar, I feel amazing. I've lost about 5 pounds in the last month, which feels pretty good. I'm about to up my dose to 0.5 and hoping for the best.

Honestly, Ozempic has been a game-changer for me. I'm sleeping better, feeling calm during the day, motivated to move, and no more naps. If my first month can inspire anyone out there to take that first shot, go for it. Yeah, it's scary, especially after all the scary stories you hear, but it could change your life. Don't be afraid to take the plunge. Cheers to better days ahead! ??"

Woke up every night with chest pains and an uneasy stomach feeling. I felt like I had the flu for 9 months. My skin ached, doctor told me it was a side effect of diabetes, not the meds.

She said uncomfortableness would last a few days.

I immediately felt like I had Covid or the flu for 22 days. A slow recovery after. I was so sick to my stomach and had diarrhea or constipation so badly I did not eat an entire 22 days. The 22nd I knew things would start shutting down so I forced half of a banana down. The next day the same. I slowly was able to eat more butI couldn’t because my stomach was so incredibly ill and hurting the entire 22 days. Of course I lost 16 pounds those 3 weeks… but I would not quit and do it again. I was able to stretch my first pen with 0.25 and put it in my thigh starting the second week, I’ve since heard that as a recommendation. I cannot tell you the next 2 weeks were any easier. I’d have spells of fever at 103° and drank as much water I could. Probably 16oz a day. 1 glass. Forced. It felt horrible once I did but I knew I needed water. I probably should have gone to the er for fluids and nutrients.. if that’s possible. I was determined. I couldn’t get out of bed like sick unless I ran to the restroom. Absolute misery."

I too take ozempic and my reasons are a bit different. I have hypogycemia and was obese. The delayed digestion has been good for me. I used to get sick at my stomach and dizzy and have to eat all the time it seemed. I ended up at 195 and am about 5"" 8"". I am now at 148.  I have had side effects unlike my DD but have stuck with it and will. I also have very bad flat feet that have broken down over the years so I could hardly walk, was heading for a wheelchair. with weight loss, I can now get around so much better. By the way I am 77. My worst problem is constipation, I have always had a problem so nothing new. but it has been really bad, I have used Miralax, and enemas. I have worked on my diet to try to help and it has some. The main issue I had was overeating because of hypoglycemia and I also like to eat, LOL! and the wrong stuff. It got rid of a lot of cravings and I eat less, but most anything I want.  I can attest to the fact that if you eat to much you will get sick. In my case really sick, than I feel like I will vomit but don't. This has happened 4 or 5 times and I just quit eating to much, solved that problem. I also have gas, so I started taking a gas relief pill in the evening and stopped that. This is a good product, but like anything its no magic answer. You can't just take it and keep eating what you did and as much, it won't work and you will be sick. I too have never had to take more than .5mg per week. The last 2 months I've reduced to .25mg to help get rid of the constipation issue. I am still slowly losing some weight, hope to get to 145, but it has slowed down, which I expect. You have to work to make this medication work. Best thing that has happened for DD and I very pleased with the results."

It has been more than a year now and she weighs 125 and has a normal BMI and takes no other drugs for diabetes. She never had a shot larger than .50 mgand is still on it as her glucose and other levels are and have remained normal. This has been the best thing in the world for her.

I’ve been taking at the lowest dose .25 for almost 8 weeks. I’ve lost 15lbs. and all interest in food or alcohol. Not caring or even thinking about food or your next meal and not worrying about how you will resist food is incredibly freeing. The bad news is the side effects. After a shot, I feel so tired. Twice now I’ve had terrible diarrhea, which happened the two times I injected myself in the stomach instead of my thigh. Also had some mild nausea and horrible sulfuric burps. So far, it’s still worth it if the side effects can be managed but they’re no joke. I’m unlikely to increase my dose at this point bc I think the side effects would be unmanageable. Another downside is that it makes is challenging in some ways to change your diet bc I don’t want anything, much less extra veggies or a salad.

I did more research; it can effect & cause gallbladder, mood swings,liver, pancreatitis etc problems. I notified Dr.B, guess what; “NR”. I shot off a serious portal message to him. He ordered bloodwork & ultrasound. Bloodwork was fine; However, the ultrasound found gallstones & the same Dr recommended gallbladder removal! more research, gallbladder is important. I told him i want the medication that helps rid the stones or laser treatment. I’ve been referred to Hepatology. He still denies any relationship. Pay attention to your body, ask lots of questions, get response in writing. I’m off it for 3 weeks. My night munching has returned & craving sweets. Idk. i may return to a lower dose if gallstones can be removed w/o surgery. I will defer to Hepatologist. I NOW know I will gain back all my weight over time, per the Dr B.

It does seem to help control my appetite as I feel full after eating about half of what I used to at meals.  My concern is that my blood sugar numbers are out of whack.  I was on metformin and glipizide and my morning reading was usually between 120 and 140 and my A1c was at 6.8.  My doctor took me off theglipizide and now my numbers have ranged from 108 to 211 in the morning.

Mack,65-74,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,2.6666666666666665,3,4,1,1,0,"I have Type 2 diabetes which is well controlled, but couldn’t weight ( 350+ lbs.).The first month everything was good. Started at .25mg and increased to .5 for month 2 & 3. On .5 I started having acid reflux on day of injection. Took 1 Prilosec with shot and had no reflux. Started 4th month on 1.0mg. The really bad side effects started 3 days later after first dose of 1.0 mg. Almost constant belching of foul sulfurous tasting gas. Extreme bloating and abdominal pain, but no vomiting or diarrhea.However, I had what I can only describe as “splatter flatulence”, mostly mucus 10 to 15 times daily, usually triggered by eating 1 or 2 bites of anything. Day 3 & 4 I could make it to the bathroom, day 5 I couldn’t. That night things got so bad I almost went to the ER, but couldn’t get away from the bathroom. I’ve lost 23lbs some of which is due to side effects and not being able to eat.
   *GOOD NEWS!*  I found a cure for the side effects. One heaping Tsp. of Manuka Honey once or twice a day. Noticeable improvement immediately. By the 2nd day I was back to normal. I will not be taking Ozempic again. Google Manuka Honey for more info on healing properties. It’s even being used with surgical dressings to prevent infection (per article, which I have read, in The Journal of American Medicine). It doesn’t taste like regular honey but has an herbal flavor with sweet honey undertone. The taste may be off putting to some at first, but far better than the sulfurous burps which decreased immediately along with the other symptoms. I had some in my pantry that I had ordered from Amazon, but have since seen it in my grocery store. It is more expensive than regular honey, but I would pay triple for the healing effects. Research it and all will be explained including reason for higher price and various uses."

I lost more weight with Ozempic than having lap band surgery. If I inject more than 0.5mg each week I have nausea and lethargy. I also experience vision loss (about 30% loss), whatever amount of Ozempic I take. I have not read anything about Ozempic causing vision loss. Please let me know if anyone else has had this issue. I have been to an eye doctor and he couldn’t find any major issue with my eyes. As soon as I go off Ozempic my vision isback to normal.

Started taking Farxiga and using both quick acting and long acting insulin. I cleaned up my diet and eliminated all sugar and processed foods, with a focus on veggies and white meat chicken. Stopped drinking alcohol and limited drinks to coffee, unsweetened iced tea and water. 3 weeks after leaving the hospital I was prescribed Ozempic. Took .25 for 2 weeks, then .5 for 2 weeks, then 1mg for 3 weeks, and just started taking 2mg today. Only side affect I have had is mild constipation. 4 weeks into taking ozempic my A1C fell to 11.2… at this time I stopped using my quick acting insulin with meals. 3 weeks later my A1C came back at 5.7…. My weight is currently at 224#.

To combat constipation I began consuming 2 cups of black coffee each day. Usually 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon. I didn’t like it black initially so I would add ice to it to cool it down so I could chug it fast. Over time I’ve come to like black coffe and enjoy it hot now. I also eat 1-2 sugar free greek yogurts each day. I’ve been doing this for 6 weeks or so now and I have little or no constipation. Oh, I also have found that if I fail to eat I become constipated so I feel that making sure I eat small food potions a couple times a day works. I also bought an Apple Watch and make sure that I walk 10k steps per day. That’s my journey so far with type 2. Hope my journey continues on this positive track."

I was placed on ozempic as it is impossible for me to lose weight due to an extremely low metabolic rate. 
I’ve been on 0.25 weekly for 4 months. I’ve lost 30 pounds. Purely based on weight loss, I never needed to up the dose. — so that has been great. I inject into the outside of my upper thigh. 
The side effects however, yikes. Even on the lowest dose, they have been no joke for me to the point where I have to stop the medicine. I’ve eaten so little, andeven at that level I get explosive diarrhea, severe severe abdominal cramping from both gas and muscle convulsions, vomiting. It’s like my stomach is constantly tearing itself apart, even if the only thing I ate was 6 saltines. It’s basically been 4 mos of diarrhea, so I take Imodium and multiple gas x every single day. I’ve taken vitamin b6 and b12 as well as unisom to help with the nausea (same treatment course that helped my morning sickness). 
This med is wild and impacts people so differently. Most everything says .25 doesn’t do much, but I am the case study in that not being accurate. But feeling like a fork is twirling around my intestines like spaghetti isn’t a way to live.

In the 3 weeks I have taken it my blood sugars have gone from the mid 300 range to the mid hundreds range and I have lost 8 pounds. I love what it has done for me.
SADLY...after next week I will no longer be able to use it. In March I  was 64 and with my insurance  I  paid $25 a month. In April I am 65 and now have medicare with a  separate prescription insurance.  NowOzempic will cost me $579 a month and  the word ""medicare""  keeps me from  qualifying for a company reduction in cost.
So now I am one of America's elderly who no longer matter. I  shouldn't qualify for a medication that can help me live longer evidently. 
As far as I  am concerned Ozempic, companies like it, and medicare consider elderly throw away citizens!! We are the ones who really  need the savings plan but we are the ones who don't qualify. Good luck to each of you when you become one of us at 65!"

Eat crackers Ozempic website says, drink soups and lots of water... sure it all come right back out. Called the Doc. got me some meds for that, oh more meds for the meds I'm taking. Then next comes the diarrhea with no end in sight..  So I got some pills for that too.. Now week 2? Do I dare go on? Well so many people have, why can't I? It's only .25. So I did. Big mistake!

With a family history of diabetes and continued weight gain I was prescribed Ozempic in August 2022. My starting weight was 237 and now March 2023 I’ve lost 40 lbs. Yes, some mild side effects but ALWAYS due to eating a poor choice of food, in my experience. I read all the reviews before starting and was really worried so thought I would share my experience and how helpful Ozempic has been both in weight loss and insulin resistance. For me, the weight loss hasbeen gradual with some weeks showing nothing but have averaged 3-4 lbs per month. My cravings for sweets and snack foods has diminished although I do eat treats and lean into some mild cravings. I also seem to have lost my desire for red meat?!. Everyone has a different experience but all of my bad side effects were the direct result of eating greasy food/fast food/rich food/etc. Yes, there is some constipation but fibre made a big difference. My rings fit, I’m 4 sizes smaller, I sleep better, food is fuel not an addiction for me and the journey has been rewarding. I walk daily and try to make good food choices. Hope this help someone ??"

Mounjaro is more effective and the pen is ready loaded ready to use.

Extremely disappointed. I am not taking this for weight loss I am taking this to lower my a1c.

A little bit of back history first I am pre-diabetic and severely obese. I started with trulicity and lost 12 lb in 5 weeks, however I was having severe leg pains and I slept almost 24 hours a day.
 Then I was on victoza which I liked but I was gaining weight and I couldn't get past the lowest dose without feeling sick. I have severe IBS issues and both medications seem to completely eliminate the IBS that I normally experience. However the side effects and the sleeping was too much for me. 
Next I went on Rybelsus while I was waiting for Ozempic to be back in stock at my pharmacy. It is basically the pill version of the Ozempic. When I was finally able to fill Ozempic my doctor told me to take 5 mg because I'd already been Rybelsus however I only started with . 25mg. I had quite a bit of nausea along with IBS symptoms. The second week I took .5mg and I felt okay for the first couple days except for I felt like I had motion sickness. Then suddenly I was running to the bathroom with severe cramping and diarrhea along with vomiting at the same time. I literally could not eat anything for 3 days and like I mentioned I have lost 10 lbs in a week. By day 6 I started to get a little bit hungry but I'm still experiencing pretty bad cramping. The cramping feels like severe bloating which is just so uncomfortable. Seeing the number go down on the scale was exciting and I'm not sure that it's going to be worth all of this sickness that comes along with it or the triggering of my IBS. I have been unable to basically leave my house for days. I think that I will do today's injection as 0.25 mg and then in a couple days inject the other .25mg in hopes to ease some of the symptoms. I've been stuck at the same weight for so long that I'm just really hopeful that this will eventually subside and continue working on the weight loss and lowering my a1c. I can tell you that when I stopped the Rybelsus, I immediately gained weight back and I felt more hungry than I did before I started any of these medications. That is something I worry about, if I end up stopping Ozempic will I gain it all back. For now I just really need to work on the foods that I'm eating and changing my lifestyle and not just relying on the injection. I'm feeling very hopeful and excited at the possibilities of this medication can do for my overall health. Best of luck to everybody that's on it. I hope that you are able to succeed with whatever goal it is that you're reaching for."

When I first started I got bad constipation. You don't eat much and I drank a lot less water then u used too which I think was the issue. That subsided. Occasionally I will get diarrhea from taking the meds now, its usually the day after if it happens. I have had those nast Sulphur burps people talk about but not often. Anytime I have stomach upset I use some Pepto and it goes away. I will probably stay at the 1 dose and work on my diet and exercise. BUT I lost about 8 pounds and my appetite is extremely reduced which I'm happy about. Having diabetes you feel hungry all the time because your body doesn't convert the sugar to energy. I can't tolerate metformin, terrible terrible diarrhea so Ozempic is like a miracle drug for me. Highly recommend it."

It makes me feel really good after take it, except náusea sometimes, but then I fall asleep and next morning it's normal, I highly recommend not taking for losing just weight and your doctor super recommend it to you... It's expensive and you didn't take it seriously could be damages long-term, I was really scared of taking a shot, but after hours talking with my doc she convinced me, and I am.

The only issue I have is nausea twice a day but it is usually because my sugar is low. I do have to watch what I eat (no greasy or fatty foods) and I can't overdue it on the caffeine/liquor or I will throw up. So far I am very happy with ozempic."

Semaglutide,Ozempic,2/6/2023,Stringa007,35-44,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,4,5,5,2,1,0,"I started out on 0.25 for 4 weeks. I had no side effects, lost a little weight. My first increase to 0.5 was fine, still no side effects and able to function as a normal person, at this point I was getting close to 30 pounds down. After 4 weeks, I was to increase my dose to 1mg. This is when the problems started...I've had bad reflux even with 40mg prescription Nexium, extremely painful stomach cramps, diarrhea (very bad, daily, about every 20-30 minutes, terribly disgusting sulfur burps, headache, weak/fatigue (likely from the inability to eat and barely drink liquids), if you do eat - you have to force yourself to eat because of the pain, dizzy spells (especially going from sitting to standing), stomach gurgles almost back to back all day, and did I mention how bad the diarrhea is? It's like giving yourself a virus that won't go away. I've taken the 1mg for 2 weeks now and can't tolerate this anymore. My doctor is putting me back down to the 0.5 dose as I had no side effects on that and took it for 4 weeks. However, the half life on this medication is very looooong, which means even though I have taken my 0.5 dose, it'll take a few weeks before anything balances out. My blood sugar levels have been so good it is unheard of. So far, I have lost 40 pounds but not without ridiculous amounts pain, did I mention the back to back diarrhea (don't leave home), and about 13 pounds of my weight loss came from the 1mg because you are so sick you don't want to eat or drink anything. Also, on the 1mg, you might want to just throw out your daily coffee or caffeine intake altogether as it makes it unbearable. Occasionally I will take ibuprofen for the stomach pain and does help (a little). I missed 2-3 days of work since going on the 1mg but thought I actually had a stomach bug until it was daily for the last 2 weeks. I am hopeful that going back to the 0.5 will stable me out. I love my BS numbers, and the weight loss is something I've never been able to accomplish (and haven not been this small since I was in my 20's (currently 38 years old). I'm actually able to fit into WAY smaller clothing and have even enjoyed shopping a little more. I have read in the comments about a lot of people feeling depressed after taking the medication. I have not noticed this, however, I have been on an antidepressant (Lexapro) for years. I could, however, see how this medication could make you depressed if you consistently experience the side effects that I have on the 1mg dose. Fingers crossed that going backwards will return me back to normal. Also, you may want to put 4-5 layers of underpants on when you go to sleep, trust me, to be on the safe side...did I mention diarrhea? If you can tolerate the smaller dose, stick to that, I personally do not recommend going to 1mg (the devil reared his head from the bowels of my stomach). Aside from wishing I never went to the 1mg (and perhaps being malnourished and dehydrated from upping the dose, I would recommend it but only to the level your body can tolerate it otherwise you will have zero quality of life. I functioned just fine with no side effects at 0.5 but still enjoyed the weight loss, 1mg will never happen again!"

After gaining 40 pounds in 16 months, my blood sugar was unstable, I was always aIways sweating, fatigued and could not lose this weight no matter what I tried , which was a first for me. I am 5'6, slim build,  always weighing 118 to 125lbs.

I had tried metformin  but it did help. My Dr suggested Ozempic and mentioned it was not for the faint ofheart.

My first .25 injection was in the stomach, the side effects came on strong, the next day, nausea, acid reflux, sulphur burping, throwing up bile, and loose bowels. 

It has not been easy, in terms of side effects but I now inject in my thigh and they are more manageable and have diminished in severity and occurrence.

A bland diet, has been working best, I make smoothies with protein powder, fruit and unsweetened almond milk 3 times a day. 
Meat has been hard to stomach, so has cheese, pasta, or anything heavy.

Grateful this is working!"

Yes This stuff works excellent for curbing your appetite. I only eat like once a day because I'm not hungry at all. Finally after 35 years of battling overeating and food cravings, something finally stopped all that. I felt like I was a normal person. But the side effects are not worth it, because it says only 25% of people kept the weight off. I'm going off of this medication because the side effects.

Started Ozempic for weight loss on November 8th after hitting an almost all-time high weight of 236.  I just took my 9th dose this morning and am down 17 lbs.  Its always been hard for me to lose weight without incredible amounts of exercise or near starvation, so i am pleased.

So whats the journey been like?  At the .25 starting dose, all was well till between week 2-3 when i had about 2 1/2 days of aggressive diarrhea (essentially liquid form and almost uncontrollable).  Probably 20 times in that period. (That side effect led me to a blog like this where someone said they found less trouble when taking the shot in the leg vs the stomach.  I had taken the first two in the stomach and immediately switch to the leg for shots 3-9.  I have no idea if it actually helped or if my body just got used to the medicine - but i do know i wont be doing any more shots in the stomach. :))  Thankfully, in the 6 weeks since, ive only had that one time again.  Like some others, with my first ever dose i had no idea if i got any or not.  But alas, it seemed to work out.  After this initial box of .25, i was upgraded to a box of .5.  As the .5 box came to and end, my doctor was going to keep me at .5 for another cycle, but it was impossible to get the medicine at that dose so i successfully urged him to take me to 1.0.  This morning was my third shot of 1.0.  In the last two weeks i have a new symptom, with is mild vertigo.  Usually mostly in the morning after getting up quickly or after consuming sugar.  I can deal with it though, i just try to stay aware of it and what causes it.  Good luck to you all!"

I have actually lost more weight that I intended to and can't seem to make myself eat to pick my weight back up.
The biggest downside to this has been the nausea which is not nearly as bad as it was but I still have to use nausea medication within a week after my injection.
For anyone wanting to use it for weight loss it's a hell of a way to lose it as you definitely won't have an appetite but you also find yourself feeling weak because you haven't ate anything substantial."

I can barely bike 10 miles I am burping most of time. This stuff should not be on the market. Save yourmoney if you want to take off weight just stop eating because that’s all ozempic is going to do for you. Stock up on loperamide and adult diapers you will need them. Pepto for the sulfur burps. I am not using Ozempic again I am not able to keep my high blood pressure meds in me.  Again stop eating, loperamide, pepto and most importantly ADULT DIAPERS!!

If I have too much food it sits in my stomach I wind up throwing up. In the morning I am the most nauseous. Coffee makes me more nauseous. But this medicine does work! It reduces your appetite where it makes you conscious of what you are eating. You must limit your eating to small portions.

I am down 65 lbs in 7 months to 173lbs. The medication was so effective that I stayed on .25mg and then .5mg for longer than typical and have been on 1.0mg for 6 weeks. No negative symptoms for me. I've had hypoglycaemic symptoms (low blood sugar) since I was a teenager (I'm 52), but no medical tests would affirm this. Since taking Ozempic these lows are now gone, and I cried because now I finally know what just being hungry feels like. I am paying close attention to hunger cues now as my trigger to eat. I don't eat a lot in a day, but the food tastes better to me than pre-Ozempic. I feel so much better - arthritic knees don't hurt, inconvenience gone, congestion improved. I have gone from a size 20 jeans to a 10. I know my results are not typical, but for me it is an absolute miracle drug."

It was given to me for two reasons. One to help me manage my sugars better and to help me lose weight. But personally it did not help me lose weight but it did help me bring my A1C from 6.0 to 5.9. My A1C was at 6.0 before I started Ozempic. I started to use this medication somewhere in July or August of 2021, and had to stop it July of this year because I have gallbladder stones and my doctor said Ozempic is known to cause that. 
Now here is where my worry and question comes in, I question how dependent does your body become on this medication. I say this because I stopped it like I said July of this year and my sugars were ok and my A1C in August was 5.9 but November came and my A1C spiked to 7.2. How and why did this happen in 2 or 3 months? I know I was in prediabetic range but I could probably expected a rise maybe of 6 or 6.1 but 7.2? So now they said I am diabetic. 
So has this happen to anyone else? I also am going to get my gallbladder stones checked and see if I don't need surgery. Thanks Ozempic."

I also have high cholesterol but has been unaffected by my weight loss or gain (I have weighed from 52kgs up to 70kgs with no chance, also have been vegan for 7 years with no change - so I'm not hopeful here). Relatively easy to use although the syringe system is a bit fussy and having to buy the higher doses as the lower ones are unavailable in my country, and then adjusting the syringe hasn't been simple. First time I took it, in the evening and could not sleep that night, also very badly for the following 5days. Have returned to normal now. Very strong appetite supressant effects the first five days (on 0.25) then fell to relatively normal appetite again, so I was quite stressed. On my second dose, no 'nervous feelings' but the appetite suppressant effect has stronly diminished - I just don't feel like snacking, but can eat otherwise normal meals. Had diarrhea the first couple of days, nothing since. No palpitations, no nausea, no constipation, maybe a little more gas than usual. Have taken my third dose now, same feeling - no side effects but only a minimal appetite suppressant effect, let's say 20% less which is still great, but not as reported by others (not being able to eat fatty foods, not feeling hungry at all). Maybe I should up my dose."

It’s certainly not immediate, but within 10-14 days you notice a significant reduction in cravings. By the 3rd week, I was having to convince myself to eat. I have been on every medication out there to reduce my appetite (Wellbutrin, phentermine, topiramate, etc), but nothing has helped except Ozempic. The first few doses definitely caused side effects like headache, nausea, general malaise and discomfort. I almost gave up because the side effects were overshadowing the weight loss, but eventually I got accustomed to it. This certainly works so I wouldn’t hesitate to try it."

I had to go online to figure out how to use this and even when I was online watching it on YouTube I thought it was unnecessarily complicated. I’ve taken a dose, I think, except I never felt a needle go in so I’m hoping I got the medication in me but I’m not at all sure. There’s also no information that the pen will check it self back down to zero when you’ve used a dose, not that I would be able to see it.  Again I’m not sure I got a dose, but thepen did click back down to zero, which just may be a quark of the pen it’s self
I use a pen to control my cholesterol. You have a pen, you put it on your skin, you hit the button, you’re done. It’s as easy as pie and this pen is absolutely not.

That said it is highly effective in what it is supposed to do. 
A lot of doctors might be reluctant to prescribe it for weight loss because technically only Wegovy is approved for weight loss by the FDA. 
It took me a while to find somone to prescribe Ozempic, but currently getting it from QuickMD. Wegovy is backordered anyway, so cannot get it even if I was willing to pay the additional price for it. 
Speaking of, the reason I am not fully satisfied with it is the crazy high price, about 900 a month for Ozempic."

Be aware this will change how you see food, we can no longer really eat red meat often as it makes you feel heavy or nausea; that goes for pig too. A diet high in veggies and chicken and fish is our future so find some recipes to try out. Also, I found homemade broth soups like egg drop soup are easy and easy on the tummy.

It's been approximately 3wks since I last reviewed, and I said I would update as I'm not feeling as enthusiastic. I've been on the higher dose of 0.5mg for 3wks and I'm feeling quite ill most of the time. My tummy is upset every morning, I have nausea every day, and I'm vomiting every couple of days it seems. I can't understand why I've been vomiting but I can only think it might be due to the food having a slow-release from the stomach and anything that hasn't had a chance yet to digest, goes bad and therefore you've no choice but to vomit. I've also noticed that my libido is now non-existant. I've read reviews on other websites and it looks like I'm not the only person experiencing this. This isn't listed as an official side effect so maybe the side effects list needs to be updated? As a result of the always feeling ill, I've become house-bound because I no longer have the energy to go for walks and meet up with friends and I know this is very unhealthy. Anyway, I'm going to give myself another week of this and, if things don't improve, I'm going to ask my doctor to reduce the dosage back down to 0.25mg for the foreseeable.

When I started .50 mg., I began experiencing lightheadedness, heart racing with palpitations and weakness. Went to the emergency room and the said I had orthostatic hypotension which is when you go from standing to sitting your body drops more than 20 pts. Told me to stop taking Ozempic immediately. Come to find out orthostatic hypertension occurs to 10% of people taking this. That’s a pretty high percentage and should be listed openly (not in small print) as a possible side effect. Stopped taking the weekly shot and the bp is back to normal as is the heart rate. If you take it, be aware this could possible happen to you. I did regulated my insulin and lost weight in the 4 months I took it, but it’s not worth it to me to continue this."
Semaglutide,Ozempic,9/20/2022,Ozempic,25-34,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I am based in Ireland and Ozempic is €150pm here, or free if you have Diabetes. I don't have diabetes so I pay €150pm. I know the Govt are trying to reduce the price because Ozempic is half the price in France and Poland! 

I am on my fifth week of using Ozempic. The first four weeks, I was on 0.25mg, and now I'm on 0.5mg. I will increase to 1mg in a couple of weeks and stay on that for the foreseeable. 

I have lost 14.5lbs so far and I am ecstatic about that! I have PCOS and so it's been verydifficult for me to lose weight the traditional way but Ozempic makes it so easy for me. I have been feeling quite ill every morning. It starts in the early hours of the morning and lasts right through until about 10am. That's nausea, acid reflux, and an upset tummy. In the two days since increasing the dose to 0.5mg, I have been feeling these side effects a bit more. I read loads of the reviews below where some people were saying the experienced fecal incontinence. I thought I was lucky because I hadn't had that side effect since I started taking Ozempic but I actually experienced this for the first time this morning. A bit embarrassing! But, I think taking everything into consideration, it's not enough to deter me from continuing to take Ozempic. Seeing the reductions on my scales is enough to make me want to continue. 

To try and reduce the side effects, my doctor advised that I eat as low fat as possible because it's the fat the exacerbates the side effects. She's right because I can see the difference between if I eat really low fat vs. a ""normal"" meal. 

My starting weight was 260lbs and I'm 5ft 6.5"". My current weight is 246lbs and I'm feeling so much more confident in myself. My husband and I are taking a trip to Vienna in a month and I look forward to finally being able to take a proper photo of the both of us without worrying about what I look like! Yes, Ozempic can be expensive, but the confidence I now feel is priceless :)"

My starting weight was 202 lbs and I am 5'4""
I am now at 176 lbs.

I started at the .25 dose for two weeks and went up to .50 only after two weeks.
Next week I am going up to 1 mg weekly dose.
I felt slightly neauseaus at first but gravol helped with that.
I still carry around the gravol ginger shews and eat a few of those when I feel slightly nauseous. 
Gravol helps!
Aside from a slightly upset stomach, my only other complaint has been remembering to not eat too much!
When I eat too much, I don't feel well, and the one time I ate way too much, I vomited...

My typical day of eating is one boiled egg and coffee with cream for breakfast...one cup of salad and a about 2-3 oz protein for lunch and a small dinner like half a chicken breast and a few pieces  of broccoli.
If I eat more than this I feel crappy.
Sometimes I only have a cup of popcorn for dinner....
It is amazing how little I care about food now that I am taking Ozempic once a week.  
This medication has been my saving grace and I recomend it to anyone needing to loose weight."

Noticed weight loss a week or so in. Continued weekly for 4 weeks, then went to 1/2 unit. Ongoing weight loss and eating a smaller portion makes hungry feeling go away so less food intake. Switched to 1 unit after 8 weeks. Had ""heavy transit"" for one day during week 9, then normal again. Also, in the same week, i had a really bad day = feeling very sleepy and skin that was feeling sensitive. Weight loss from day one tillSept 16 = 26 lbs. The weight loss in my case is like a seesaw it will be at a certain weight for 3,4 days or so, then go down a pound, then stay again for 3,4 days then go down again liek a seesaw stock market situation. My blood glucose numbers have dramatically gone down, monitoring with CGM. Following this development, some other diabetes indicators such as pain in hands and feet have disappeared without flare ups. It's been,and hopefully will remain, a positive treatment in my situation."

The side effects (GI upset, fatigue, brain fog) can be devastating. I do believe the manufacturer recommendations regarding timing of step up doses, for most, is optimistic at best. But, here's the thing; there is no set standard, or real medical necessity, for the manufacturers step up dose timing. It is entirely possible to stay at the 0.5 mL dose for longer than a month if needed withno ill effect. My doctor agreed and prescribed me the 1.0 mL dose and recommended very incremental increased dosing. Just because you have a 1.0 mL pen, doesn't mean you have to use the entire 1.0 mL dose. From the 0.5 mL dose, I stepped up to 0.6 mL, then 0.7, 0.8, etc. This absolutely helped manage side effects and allowed a far more realistic adjustment period than the manufacturers recommended jumps of 0.25 to 0.5 to 1.0 mL."

I started at the lowest dose of .25mg and then moved up monthly. I'm currently at 1mg and will be moving to 2mg next week. I'm so pleased with this medication. I've lost approximately 35lbs so far. I've been on a strict diet and also go to the gym when I can, as well. But, I attribute most of the loss to this drug because nothing was moving the needle, until I started using it. I have barely no appetite and have to force myself to eat. I never really realized how much my life revolved around food until I didn't depend on it for comfort anymore. The only side effect I have is constipation, which I take stool softeners for. You can't expect to eat large meals with this and feel well. You really have to pretend like you just got bariatric surgery and can only digest small portions and nothing heavy. I feel this is why a lot of people report getting sick with GI issues. They continue to eat like usual. This MUST be a full lifestyle change to be effective and if you can power through some of the side effects and make the necessary healthy changes, you will be so pleasantly surprised. This changed my life for the better and I feel like a new person."

At first I loved how the weight would slowly come off. Then I started to have weird side effects such as heavy menstrual bleeding with clots, so long and heavy that I had to go to OB GYN to start oral contraceptives to stop the bleeding after 30 straight days of bleeding. OBGYN did ultrasound and said that I shouldn’t be bleeding as my endometrial tissue was very thin. 
I have had very low blood pressure reading of 80s/60s, calf cramps, and a random frozen shoulder that I had togo to orthopedics for. Never these issues before starting medication. Very bizarre.

A1c of 6.2.  I am taking Ozempic as a first line treatment for the impending diabetes and the obesity.  I have other issues related to auto-immune disease such as hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis, and IBS.  I also have asthma, elevated cholesterol, and high blood pressure.

The first thing I noticed about taking Ozempic is that my IBS was immediately relieved but I started getting mood swings and irritability.  The effectof 0.25mg wore off within 3 days and I immediately got rebound diarrhea and felt lethargic.  After increasing to 0.5mg per week, the effect lasted 5 to 6 days and then began the IBS rebound and feeling bad.  On 1mg per week, everything seems normal and I only loose control of my appetite on the 6th and 7th days, no other effect noticed.

This medication actually makes me feel normal at a full dose.  I have a bowel movement every 36 to 48 hours and have good control over my eating habits.  The only thing I have a hard time giving up are the grains, especially wheat, that seem to cause a lot of inflammation in my body.  I notice that I feel good when I especially avoid wheat. But sadly, I like bread a lot.

The hardest thing to get over is psychological dependency on eating as a way to find happiness in life and to deal with my emotions.  I am free to enjoy other things now besides eating.  My whole life seemed to revolve around eating and the planning of meals.

My experience seems to be different from others I have read here but I hope this helps.  God bless you all."

I’ve been on it long enough to take 5 once-a-week doses now,  four at 0.25 and one at 0.5. Each week, I’ve had different side effects. The first week, there was mild nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and exhaustion, Second week brought stronger nausea to the point of vomiting. Doc prescribed something for it, but it didn’t really help. Third week, the nausea went away, but there was severe constipation. Fourth week, I had sharp abdominal pains (probably due to the continuing constipation) and some dizziness. Fifth week (upped dose to 0.5), I had the first migraine that I’ve had in years, along with more nausea again, and still with the constipation.

The reason that I’ve stuck it out this long is because the doc and my mom (who has been on this med for a while) told me that the side effects would dissipate and the weight loss would be worth it. I was also told that I would lose interest in eating and I would feel full almost all of the time. Neither has been true for me. I still have the same late-night snacking urges that helped me put on the weight. The only thing that I’ve noticed is that I can’t eat as much, because I start feeling nauseous after eating about half of what I used to. The bad thing about that, though, is that I had a sleeve gastrectomy, so I was already eating about half of what a non-sleeved person eats.

I plan to try to stick it out until my next A1c (which was 9.3 at my last appointment), to see if it makes any change there. If it makes enough of.a difference there and I do actually see a dissipation of side effects, then I’ll stay on it. If the A1C doesn’t come down significantly, then I don’t see a point to the suffering that this medicine is causing me."

Manage it with pepcid and omeprazole; drink cold water.  YOU MUST EAT HIGH QUALITY PROTEIN AND VEGETABLES.  You will want to eat less, make sure it's proper building blocks.  I lost all sugar cravings! down 10 pounds in 6 weeks. Get your walking or biking in - read the insert!  do the 150 minutes per weeks exercise.  Ozempic works to support changes I have been making, nothing is a miracle cure - but this one helps nudge all your work in the right direction - you will lose weight.  If the nausea gets bad eat a graham cracker, use ginger ale with sugar.  Don't be afraid of foods any longer - just eat better since you will not feel like eating much.  Start tracking your calorie intake - you will be amazed.  If you are not motivated to lose weight then don't use the medication."

I was very dehydrated. I went and seen my GI Doctor, she did some tests on me and my white blood cells were high, my potassium low, she actually called it Anorexic. After 5 months I'm happy that I've lost 40 lbs, but all of the symptoms are still there. I've missed way too much work. I have one more dose in my pen for 1.0 mg that I'm not going to take.

Started ozempic at .25 doses... did this for 2 weeks...typical side effects (sleepiness, nausea and direahea) stayed at .25 for 2 weeks. As side effects were not that bad I moved to .50 on the 3rd week. Side effects were about the same. Today I'm taking my 3rd dose on .50 (5th over all dose)... I'm down to 170!! Woot woot! 20ish pounds in about a month. I am super happy and hope this continues. 

I am noticing that I'm barely eating.. like I'm technically anorexic based on my calorie intake... I'm just not hungry and if I do eat it's cramps and direahea.... I've also had a few instances lately were I felt something like hypoglycemia shock.. that is scary of course but when this happens I just eat some chocolate or something and I feel better. ?? 

I'm curious if anyone else has similar side effects?

I know those side effects might seem harsh but really I'm feeling pretty normal most of the time and the weight loss makes up for it!

Also my dog said I wouldn't even lose weight in the first 1 to 2 months as this is time for your body to get used to medicine and for the medicine to build up in your system, so I was very surprised to be losing weight immediately.

I’ve only lost 12 pounds since I’ve been on it and get very nauseas after taking it. It’s working though so I’m happy. It’s frustrating though that other insurance companies pat ask but $25 and people on Medicare have to pay a fortune. I still think Medicare, deductibles, prescriptions etc should be free.

I lost 20 pounds in four weeks tapering from the .25 those to the .5 dose.   Extremely impressed with the results.  Only downside after stopping as I have the sense my thyroid levels have been tweaked or affected and I’m having it tested.

I've lost 5 pounds to date which doesn't feel like very much considering how little I'm eating.  I haven't felt hunger in two weeks and my cravings are significantly less.  I'm hoping that as I go up in dosage that my weight loss will accelerate. I take other medications that increase my blood sugar levels so I'm hoping that this medication will counteract that leading to weight loss.  overall I'm veryhappy, but hoping for better results with the increased dosage.

I’m insulin resistant, obese on glycemic chart, always showed high glucose on blood work. Diabetes is hereditary in my family. I did ALL the diets . Started WW at age 12. Lost weight yes slowly plateaus for months and months then I’d eat and gain back the weight. A friend told me about metabolic clinic through our hospital and she had tremendous success. I was psyched!
I qualified for the rx and my insurance paid for a lot of it but I paid $190. A syringe which lasts 6 weeks.
Painless injection. 
So nauseous like most here. Urge to eat gone. Maybe too gone. I couldn’t eat. Was losing weight like crazy and that felt great. My dx prescribed zohran which is a life saver for me.( 4 mg maybe once a day or 5 days out of 7).
After a month I was supposed to go up to .50 but .25 was working and finally I was able to eat a little because not eating isn’t the way i
Wanted to go. My doctor said if 2.5 is working stay on it so that’s what I did it’s been about almost 3 months and I’ve lost 22 pounds I feel great weight wise but the nausea continues here and there. My doctor said to watch the carbs and sugar because that could activate the nausea and when I did that I less nausea but the thing is I really don’t want to give up things like watermelon, blueberries and some other fruit. So I’ve been staying on .25 and it still helps me to tell me when I’m full I’m still eating a fraction of what I used to eat and the good part other than the weight loss is that my blood pressure medication has been cut in half and then actually then cut in half again so for me that’s fabulous to have those meds tapered my heart doctor is thrilled with weight loss and she’s OK with this Way to go to lose weight I’d to have questioned whether I wanna keep living like this in order to stay sinner or less fat and I don’t know how long I can do this it’s a nausea doesn’t ever subside . Many days I feel just fine so I really have to probably start watching what I’m eating to see what the reaction is and I’m finding that if I eat watermelon at night and I feel fine I don’t feel fine the next morning I am so thankful for this medication and somebody finally addressing the fact that we overweight people need some help as well I plan on going back to Weight Watchers only to get the camaraderie and I’d like to listen to the strategies of a diet plan. sometimes though I’m so tired I can’t exercise it’s weird I have normal days and then days where I’m just really tired. My doctors are taking blood frequently and keeping eyes on what’s going on which makes me feel good I don’t blame anybody for not being able to continue on this medication because it is a little rough but if it’s not that bad it’s a miracle drug I wish it wasn’t so incredibly expensive and The drug manufacturers would stop overcharging us crazy prices if you find that your pen doesn’t deliver the correct amount you can contact them which is what I did when my pen didn’t give me the correct doses and they actually gave me a coupon for a free pan which was great because it cost me $190 a pen they said they would send me an envelope to get the pan to see what’s wrong with it but I waited for weeks and they never sent it so I threw out the pen . One thing I don’t understand is the pen clearly states that after six doses even if you have more medication left in the pen you must throw it out I don’t understand why especially since it cost so much money why that’s something that you have to do it makes me feel like maybe the company is just trying to get more money out of us and of course that’s not right."
Semaglutide,Ozempic,7/25/2022,SuccessFinally,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I've been on Ozempic for 4 months. My doctor tiered the dosage from .25 mg for 4 weeks, then .50 mg for 4 weeks, then increased to 1 MG for the remaining time. I've just gone in for a check up, and increased to the 2 mg dose beginning this week. 
Each dose I experienced some stomach knots, but they resolved after the first day of the adjustment. I did initially have some very mild nauseum but all I needed to do, was take a sip of cold water to take care of it. I stress, the nauseum was very verymild. I do have a bit of constipation, but I balance with stool softeners and strict keto (high fat). 
I've lost 21 pounds to this point and this medication is the first thing that's controlled my appetite. I used to feel hungry all the time but now I don't feel like I need to eat all the time. I don't snack all the time like I used to.
I was doing everything I was supposed to, I was working out and strict keto. But, I was stuck and couldn't lose any more weight. The medical community doesn't treat obesity like a medical condition, they just look at us like we can't control ourselves and we're lazy. 
I'm happy that I haven't had the severe side effects that others have, Ozempic has been a valuable tool in my weight loss journey. I hope to continue on it."

I approached my weight loss doctor about the possibility of using Ozempic/Wegovy for weight loss (I have a BMI of 38, 240Lbs at 5' 4""). I have been on it for 4 months now with tremendous results. I have tried many other plans, including every diet imaginable, WW, Gastric Banding, Gastric Bypass, etc, with temporary success. But nothing would ever remove the feeling of being ""hungry"" and wanting to binge. Ozempic has done the trick. 

Yes, there are side effects that can be uncomfortable. If you are nauseous, ask your doctor for Zofran (an anti-nausea medication that really works). If you have gas, use simethicone 250mg. 

I realize I may need to remain on this for the rest of my life, but that is a small price to pay to reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes & stroke, which all run in my family. Thank you, Novo-Nordisk!"

Besides the occasional bout of nausea and fatigue when moving up a dose, it’s been fine thus far, apart from my most recent dose change. I took the .5 for 5 weeks, since on the fifth week I didn’t have access to the 1 mg pen yet, and I took my first dose of 1 mg just the other day and I have been violently ill since. I just wish there was a .75 mg marking instead of it being strictly a 1 mg pen, because doubling your dose like that really sucks. I’ve gagged countless times, can’t stay fully upright for long due to stomach problems, appear to have gastroparesis, and nearly all the contents of my stomach are liquefied, but haven’t passed on to the intestines yet. I’ve also had gas pain through the roof and also have burped a lot more than normal, despite me having GERD regardless of the Ozempic. Because of the nausea, that burping nearly makes me throw up every single time. I’ve been stuck in a recliner unable to move because of surgery before, and had a laparoscopic gallbladder removal, but nothing has ever really affected me this bad, apart from COVID-19. I’m seriously considering going to the emergency room if this doesn’t let up. The 1 mg pen also isn’t near potent enough; because of the sheer volume of the 1 mg dose, it pooled in the injection site and was extremely uncomfortable.

I did have side effects when I started but the ability to turn away food and know when my body was full far outweighs any discomfort. It is an injection which is a little unnerving but the needle is super small. 
I just had my lab work done and all my levels were fine. I have been doing a .5 ml but will be switching to the 1 ml next week. I still exercise everyday and eat right, it’s not a miracle drug, but Ozempic has given me that little extra boost to get my weight loss journey started."

I started with the usual .25 dose for 4 weeks and it didn't do anything in terms of weight loss or for hunger. I felt mild symptoms, mostly just tiredness but nothing too terrible. When I increased the dose to .50, the tiredness increased as well and I felt a little discomfort at times, but again nothing major. I did not lose any weight and it did not help with hunger. I am now on my second week at the 1.0 dose and my hunger is completely gone. I have no cravings for food and I find that I am for needing my tell myself to eat. I started a low calorie diet(Noom) on June 01/22 as well, and I am happy to say that in since then(17days ago) I have lost 13lbs. I think the combination for Ozempic at 1.0 dose and the low cal diet is the magic wand and is working for me. I have bouts of dizziness, still very tired but the lbs are melting off almost effortlessly.

Just dosed 8th week on Wed.  First four weeks 2.5 now using.5.  Only problems I experienced at .25 was moderate bloat and foul burping.  Did not lose weight or experience any nasty nausea or constipation.  Past four weeks at .50, drastically different effects and results.  So nauseaus, throwing up frequently, like 2-3x per day, bad constipation which leads to more vomiting.Or if i begin to heat up and start sweating.

I've read enough of these reviews to know what can occur so I'm roughing it out until my follow up next week with my Dr.  I've lost ~15bs these past four weeks.  My blood sugar went low for the first time in my life so I've discontinued Humalog 20 units x2 daily and I'm testing good range glucose-normal for 2 weeks now. Dr also took me off Januvia to start so I'm taking .50 ozempic and Jardiance only now.  Honestly I don't think I can keep this up unless the nausea and tiredness subsides which I hate to think of stopping since it is working.  Just some nasty nausea and constipation, very little appetite. My urination has drastically been reduced, too. I've read where people say that's because the sugar isn't needing to be flushed as frequently frequently and I know I'm not drinking enough water because I'm always full."

My headache came back today -maybe because I ate a heavy-sugar snack?  As others previously mentioned, I have that ""weird"" feeling in my tummy. lol, it's not even something you can identify with to be honest, it's just weird. The feeling of not needing to eat is there, the mental part is the difficult part- I KNOW that Nanaimo bar tastes good... do I really want it-- or just recall that it tastes good.. weighing in whether to tackle it or not...yet side tracked in any way takes me away from the memory of good food. So that's good!
Gas-- yes biggest gassy noises ever- glad I can go outside quickly to pass. Needle is not worth mentioning- simple, no pain, just sit on skin, press button, count and release. Simple. 
I do not know of it's effectiveness yet, however I know my daughter lost 16lbs in two weeks. The cost is not covered for me, but it is so important for me to take the weight off my knees that it's worth scrimping for- plus I will buy less goodies! Win-win. I will touch base as my body decides what it's going to do.. Way too many diets, too silly to have surgery and risk my life- this could be a real God-send to so many of us that have been on the yoyo dieting train for too many years to count! Good Luck to all."

I didn't vomit (phew) but I wasn't able to function effectively.  Dropping back to .25 has helped a lot, but it doesn't bring the sugars down as much as I would like.

So far I’ve lost about 10lbs, my need for food is way less than it was and I can totally go without food for a while, and when I do eat I only eat a tiny bit then I’m completely full!

The use of the pen is super easy and I like how it comes with the needles.

It’s like someone turned a switch on in my brain that was accidentally shut off. I now feel full after eating even half a sandwich or a small bowl of oatmeal. I can’t actually believe it because it’s so strange to just be able to walk away from food because I’m full. I don’t think I’ve felt this since I was a child. I’ve lost about 7 lbs. I have definitely experienced some vomiting but mostly at night which is similar to what I had from reflux. Definitely had some constipation and the burps are miserable- but again with my weight gain I had terrible reflux so I was sort of used to it- I’m praying it keeps working because I finally feel like I can have a normal relationship with food.

Took one injection at LMC and took the second at my home.  Really back diarrhea and then stomach pains.  Stopped taking the injection because I felt worse than ever.  Two weeks or so later I broke out into a rash and welts all over my body.  Doctors at LMC said it was psoriasis and had nothing to do with the Ozempic.   I am 73 years old.  Psoriasis at my age?  Really?  Then my family doctor referred me to a dermatologis who said not Psoriasis but performed a biopsy to be sure.  Lab came back with not psoriasis and could not rule out Ozempic.   After 72 years of no allergies, I now have an allergy to semiglutide.

I thought once my breakout cleared up after medicating topically for more than 3 months, I actually have a worse reaction to Ozempic.  My Thyroid started failing.  Their list of side effects said Thyroid tumors or cancer.  They didn't say anything about Thyroid slowing down.  I now have to take medication to try and fix my Thyroid. 

What did Ozempic do for me?  It slightly lowered my blood sugar. It gave me an allergy to semiglutide.   Affected my Thyroid Stimulating Hormone and put it higher than it should be which now caused me severe weight loss; muscle loss; fatigue; extreme difficulty climbing stairs.  No strength at all.  Also, the Thyroid issue causes problems with swallowing.  Not just food, but water as well.

This was the worst experience I ever had with a drug.  It looks like I'm going to being paying for it for as long as I live."

I've read ALL the reviews and yes, the nausea, bloating, belching, are there but once your body gets used to the drug you WILL be good to go.  This stuff changes the way food passes thru your system and emulates the GLP1 hormone and that's a phenomenal thing!   I am the leanest I've been in 25 years.  Lost 25 lbs which was every bit of my excess fat, the medicine has taken away my urge to eat all the time and when I do I feel full very quickly!  A great thing!

The stomach ache and vomiting is unusual but I didn't link it to the meds because again I hadn't read any reviews or any info at all really,  but by the 4th day after dose increase (today) severe cramping in my stomach and vomiting almost immediately after eating,  burps that smell and taste rotten  i decided to look for some answers,  im not sure about weight loss yet but I haven't even tried to eat again,  im actually scared to so yeah im sure weight-loss would follow so I guess the question is weather or not I can handle this and of course how long it lasts , I know if I can lose weight and keep it off I would like to be able to hang in there but I guess time will tell, I will try to remember to update my progress on here and hopefully help someone with my story but in the end its up to the individual and what weight-loss is to them as in any diet witch is why some work well for certain people and yet not at all for others Good luck to all of u and God  bless"

I started with 0.25 dosage, then moved to the 0.5 dosage and am now on my first week of the 1mg dose. I reacted very well to the medication and stay pretty active as well. As of April 13, 2022, I’m down to 298lbs.I’m so excited for the future as my doctor has been amazed and excited by my results. A low carb diet really is the difference paired with working out consistently. A good resource is to use the Carb Managerapp, it helps to see to gauge how many carbs/fat/sugars you are intaking on a daily basis. The results take time, but keep going and stay encouraged!"

Using this along with trying to eat right and walk.  I am not hungry and get full quicker. My doctor actually started me on Wellbutrun and Naltrexone for about a month or so then added Ozempic 0.25.  It does cause bad constipation so I take a stool softener EVERY DAY.  I need to lose 25 more lbs and I will be at my goal.

It is easy to read, I just move the dial to 0.25 mg. I am to take 0.25 for 1 month, 0.5 for a month and then move to the 1mg dose pen. Because I read hundreds of reviews first, I took it in the leg. I have had minimal side effects, if any. I started over 300 pounds and I am down about 7 pounds. Before taking this I had severe swelling in my legs for over a year that limited how I could move. The swelling in my legs has been gone now for about a week, and I feel so much stronger. I was able to stand on my feet so much easier for activities. I eat smaller portions because I feel fuller. I will keep in touch as I know more or after changing the dose. I am a little bit fatigued, but I was much more fatigued before I started to take it."

The steroids made me insulin resistant. I was on weight gaining medicine prescribed by a couple of my specialist for my other conditions that were helping me walk again and I didn't realize it. So my doc put me on Metformin and Ozempic for three and a half weeks. So my internist doc put me on Metformin for two weeks then added Ozempic.  Had to come off allinsulin.  it was in three days of taking this Metformin I lost 3 lb. My doctor recommends .25mg  for the first 4 weeks and then I'll go up .5 mg for another 4 weeks then if needed the 1 mg. Which I think has helped with the manageable symptoms. She has found the combo helps to not need to go to high on the Ozempic. I think the slow dosing is the way to go for me. I am probe to whatever severe side effects are in meds.  But I've only had some nausea bloating, headache, constipation but all mild and tolerable. I take daily probiotics and eat a diet full of  foods that help with digestion like kimchi, cabbage, onions or yogurt etc. I also recommend magnesium supplement on occasion. I also significantly increase my water and got one of those 2.2 L bottles. I realize when I don't drink enough water the constipation occurs.  I have been eating paleo since 2011. So while while trying to lose weight, I've been keep my carbs moderately low like around 70 g and my proteins between 80 and 100; high in good fats. 5'11 and started at 340. I have noticed when I eat I really rich dish and I really have upset stomach afterwards. I had a decrease appetite and full wicked fast immediately after taking Ozempic. I get all my carbs from fruits, nuts and vegetables. If I eats sweets it's not with cane sugar  but paleo and keto kind when I have a craving. I can't tolerate most of the sugar substitutes so I use coconut sugar but don't really have a sweet tooth now. Gluten gives me inflammation. So when I do make a sweet it's usually with a nut flour/butter. So in three weeks I am down to 328 at my last weigh-in. Again I think so and study those wins the race. Changing my diet. Getting my body moving in some way. for me it was just minimal walking. 

I have been successful in loosing weight in the past but nothing was working. This Ozempic and metformin has been amazing for me after almost 1 year in trying to lose weight on my own."

I started Ozempic on 3/31/22 at the 0.25 dose. I had little to no side effects from my first dose. I felt a little tired and maybe a little bloated but nothing major. I did notice right away I wasn’t hungry or craving sweets like before. I was full much faster and that feeling really surprised me as before i felt like I could eat eat forever and never be satisfied. I really like the feeling of being full and not constantly thinking about food. In my first week I have lost down to 226. I just took my 2nd  0.25 dose today 4/6/22 and so far no side effects just hopefull for more weight loss. My A1C is 6.4 and sugar in morning runs 140s.

Ive been put on 0.25mg for the time being, we found out i was insulin resistant so my doc wanted me to loose some weight.
Other than a little nausea and some constipation (nothing some raw probiotics can't fix) I feel fine. I do think starting on a lower dose has a huge impact on how severe your symptoms can get.
The scale fluctuates. I can't get a real reading on my weight loss. I'll be down 3 kgs 1 day, then up again in 2 days.
It's definitely helped with portion control. I get fuller much quicker now. Over all water retention has dropped I don't feel so 'puffy'. - my legs, ankles and feet were becoming so swollen for over 3 months - that's stopped now.
Over all I feel great to be honest. Let's hope there will be a little more weigh loss over the next few weeks...."

In short this drug has been AMAZING. All the negative reviews had me terrified. There were some side effects. The burping, bloating, and nausea are mainly linked to what I chose to eat (and how much of it). Only eat half of what you’re used to.  Even if you still feel hungry, stop eating. In about 5–10 minutes you’ll feel super full and if you keep going you’re going to feel so bloated and nauseous. I was an emotional eater, I craved things relentlessly. Now I hardly think about food. It gives you the chance to make good decisions because sweets and fast food just don’t sound good. I haven’t given up anything I want, I just don’t want it."

Despite all this I would highly recommend ozempic. I have pcos and have tried many 'diets' over the years and can honestly say this is the most effective thing I have tried. I did not change my diet (I followed the guidance by my supplier to continue eating as normal), the idea of this is to your train your brain to eat smaller portions of your usual meals, so I never ever felt deprived or that I was dieting - ozempic massively reduced my appetite so it has been so easy to adjust to eat smaller portions. The benefits of this has far outweighed the odd couple of days feeling a bit off."

This drug has been a blessing yet a curse. Over the past 5 months I have lost 30 pounds, which is amazing. 10/10 for the fact that I have been able to achieve this with this medication. The only changes I made were to my diet, no more take out (rarely ate it and when I did I paid the price). Did barely any physical activity to lose the weight.  

I have been struggling to loose the weight and this really gave me the kick start I needed to get on track. I’m now 25 pounds away from my goal weight. 

Pros: weight loss and feeling so much better about myself 

Cons: don’t over eat or you’ll pay. Crazy stomach pain, gross burps, vomiting. It was crazy. 


Yes, some times it was really bad. But the goal is to loose the weight and get off it and maintain. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is obese and their weight is a concern to their health. But you must change your diet to be clean and not over eat or else you will have the worst experience. Eat salads!"

I’ve done 0.25mg for 2 weeks, then 0.5mg for 2 weeks. So far I’ve lost about 2kg, but I didn’t expect to lose much while I was weaning on. 

I’ve had pretty minimal side effects, just a little nausea & slugishness, kind of like an early pregnancy feeling. But it’s eased as times gone by. 

I inject into my thigh which a lot of people say reduce side effects. 

It’s interesting because I have always struggled with eating, very much an all or nothing kind of eating disorder. But Ozempic has been able to help me regulate eating at a more appropriate balance. For example I can have a snack sized chocolate bar once a day and be satisfied, in the past if I was on sugar I’d eat a whole Block of chocolate and that’s all id want all day. 

I crave healthy foods too like fruit and veg. 

And even on the days where I haven’t had great eating I haven’t gained any weight.

I was eating very healthy, exercising and doing everything I could but couldn’t lose a pound. My dr suggested Ozempic and I was pretty skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. I was 190 lbs. I started at the 0.25 dose for the first 2 weeks but let me tell you that the day I did my injections I thought I was going to literally die that night. I was up all night with diarrhea, vomiting and severe sweating and abdominal cramping from hell. I decided to stick it out and see if it would get better and it did. I was actually terrified when I had to increase to my 0.5 dose but surprisingly it was much better. Within the first 2 weeks I had dropped 13 lbs.I had no appetite really and found I had to remember to eat at times, I had zero cravings and normally I’m a chocoholic! I couldn’t believe it! I continued to drop weight and at times it would plateau for a few weeks and I’d be puzzled as to what was going on and then all of a sudden it would drop suddenly again. I’ve been on the 0.5 now for about 5 months and am down 38 lbs. I’ve just recently started experiencing some issues with low blood sugars, shakiness, excessive fatigue, sugar cravings and hunger again so after seeing my dr yesterday he’s suggested dropping back down to the 0.25 to see if it helps. I have found the pens very easy to use. My dr actually suggested I purchase the 2ml pens and taught me how to count the clicks(18 is 0.25 ml) and (36 is 0.50ml) and I just mark it with a sharpie. I have no coverage and this has helped with cost so just a little tip that’s helped me. Hope this is helpful information. I would highly recommend this medication"

My hunger was ravenous when I came off of itand I sadly gained most of my weight back. After a few months I decided to give it another try after my weight loss/diabetic Dr. contacted me with an idea of a drug to help with the constipation. I found it difficult to take because it was an hour before each meal and my work schedule made it very difficult to do so. I am now trying lactulose to try and help. So far, so good. I have lost a few of the pounds I gained back and my hunger is decreased significantly. I do like this product for its positive side effects of weight loss and lowering my A1c levels. I am crossing my fingers that I can stay on it with minimal side effects, as I was able to go off of Metformin and lose significant weight."

Semaglutide,Ozempic,1/12/2022,Vivian,55-64,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,5,5,5,5,1,0,"My Dr suggested Ozempic about 7 months ago, for obesity.  I had tried everything to lose weight.  I had gained a lot off additional weight during the first few covid lock downs.  My weight 10 months ago was 270 pounds.  I lost the first 30 pounds on my own and then in July, at 240 pounds, started with ozempic.  I've lost at a steady rate of close to 1 pound per week.  I'm now down to 196 pounds.  

I started with .25 and gradually increased dosage.  Amazingly, I almost immediately felt full after a few bites during a meal.  I had never experienced that feeling before.  In the past I could eat endlessly, and not realize it until much later that I was too full.  
I do burp, occasionally constipated  and experience some fatigue.  I also experienced heart burn. I've now become aware that my fatigue is related to my sugar levels dropping to low.  And the rest of the symptoms can be managed by eating less at one sitting.  

With ozempic, the food in my stomach is very slow to digest.  Hence the burping and heart burn.  It stays in your stomach much longer,  helping you feel full longer.  
My Dr warned me that rich, or oily foods could cause upset stomach and diarrhea.   So I was very careful initially with what I ate.  Now, my meals are do small, a few bites of something rich doesn't impact me.  Surprisingly though, I have very little interest in the desserts and snacks that I did in the past.  

I'm so pleased with how this has worked for me!"

After trying a calorie restricted diet of under 1200 cals for many years that had stopped working despite strict adherence, and daily exercise for 3 hours/8-9 kms walking for nearly a year now that did not result in significant weight loss. 
The first week was rough, in bed with migraine, nausea, heartburn and fatigue the third day. Constant nausea.  The second week I reduced the dose from 20 pen clicks to 17 (less than the starting dose of0.25) and that reduced the side effects. At 6 weeks on the reduced dose, I still have a lot of burping, mild crampy abdominal pain, heartburn at times managed by Tums, and low grade nausea.
However, my previously constant ravenous hunger that distracted me so much I was actually misdiagnosed with ADHD at one point, is now a more normal hunger at mealtimes. I have not changed my low calorie diet and am still exercising 3+ hours daily. But after a year of no weight loss on that strict regimen, adding Ozempic even at this low dose, has resulted in a steady 1 lb per week loss or more. After 6 weeks, I am down almost 10 lbs and no longer in the obese category. But the miracle is that I am not tortured by hunger 24/7 anymore. My hunger used to wake me up at night, now I can sleep through and wait for a light breakfast. I am going to try going back to the 0.25 dose this week and hope the severe side effects do not return. I wrote this so others who may be more sensitive to the side effects can know that you do not have to start at 0.25 but the pen can deliver a smaller dose with fewer clicks and it still works."

Having struggled with my weight d’or zither best part of four decades decided I needed help and this seemed the crutch that could help me.  Started out well.  Some sleep issues and gas but nothing unbearable.  After 18lbs loss in 3 months and 2 progressions from 0.25 to 0.75 I started to experience a really negative side effect:  major hair loss.  I have a big mane and it was coming out from the root in clumps.   I went to see my dermatologist thinking it must be something to do with stress or some allergy and he asked me what I had started doing two to three months ago.   I told him I had started ozempic and he looked it up.  There they were - reviews of others who had experienced severe hair loss.  Nowhere on the box or on ozempic’s site was it mentioned.  So fat and hairy or slim and bald?   That was Sophie’s choice.  I had started to flatline and was feeling strangely “low” in mood  anyway so decided to come off it and try the old fashioned boring way, again.   My weight doctor wants to explore other options but I am inclined to forget the miracle aids for now.  I should mention that my dermatologist did say there was a chance that the body would adjust and the hair loss would cease.   Then again, there was a chance it would continue.   Just want to share this as it was a real concern."

Before starting the medication, I read some reviews that injecting into thighs instead of abdomen prevent side effects, and it was true. I have lost nearly 20 lb with following a health diet and reducing calorie. My fasting blood sugar, which was around 7.5 has dropped significantly, often in the normal range. I anticipate my A1C is dropped to normal range based on my random reading. I feel great and energetic even though that I have reduced my eating. So give this a try but only inject into thighs and it works. I hope Ozempic would be covered with my insurance, but it is not. This is a game changer med, but I hope those side effects seen in animal studies (pancreas and thyroid conditions) would not be developed with long-term use."

I figured severe stomach problems wouldn't be good in that case.  But, I did not have the severe diarrhea that other people are listing (I'm constipated but I was constipated before I started Ozempic, but that is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars on Ease of Use).  I started on the .25 mg two weeks ago, my morning blood sugar was around 150-160 when Iwas taking 1000mg ER of metformin, now they are down to 120-130.  I'm thinking they will go down more once I go up to the .5 mg.  I have lost a little weight, but weight wasn't an issue for me to begin with.  I love only having to take one shot a week (which I don't hardly feel at all) as opposed to two big horse pills that I was taking of the Metformin.  I'm not craving sugar anymore either.

I was 315lbs, now I am 303.  I find my appetite is not like it used to be.  no cravings, when I eat, after I eat 1/2 my usual portion, I am full.   Digestion is slower. I took a couple wks for the medicine to kick in to get my brain on board with the size of my portions and the first week I ate too much and it gave me the runs, and one day that I totally pigged out on mcdonalds and pizza i had both runs and nausea.  Have not had a recurrence since.  I am not hungry, I eat what I want, although, when I eat too much sugar, my glucose spikes...duh.  It doesn't stop you from making stupid decisions if you make them with smaller portions.   Overall i like how it is helping me with my weight and that can only have a positive affect on my a1c and blood pressure.   I have had to use prune juice a couple times but i am getting used to only 1x/day BM instead of my normal 2 when I ate too much.   I have no other side affects, I feel great, I have more energy and am hopeful that I can lose weight without even trying.  It feels like a miracle.  I have been in the 300's since 2012.  I have tried weight watchers and others but I always felt hungry and so sabotaged my diet or program.  I am so excited to be in the 200's soon.  I have a needle phobia so at first I delayed taking because I was afraid of sticking myself.  I put mine in the flab that is under my arm.  alternating one arm one week and the other the next. just put my arm on table with flab rolled forward and stick it press, hold and done. I don't feel it at all.  i picked arm cuz reviews showed those who use in belly have more GI issues.  could be imaginary, but i figured its easier in my arm anyway and I can do anywhere. I then shake my arm, pat the fat and do some air punches to get it not to stay in one area cuz I fear it will hurt if it doesnt dissapate...thats my own hypothesis.   Anyway.... good luck.  I will report back on my A1c.  btw, I am a 59 yr old woman, actve, no unmanaged health prob except diabetes and weight.  I am not sedentary, I  have tried to walk at least a 1/2 mile 5x/wk but goal up to 5mi a day like I used to.  Knees bug me with all the weight, but getting easier."

A couple of weeks of heartburn at first, but once I learned that I wasn't really hungry every 3 hours, the heartburn stopped.  I was able to change my diet and I have lost 25 pounds in 5 months.

Semaglutide,Ozempic,8/7/2020,Ali Mara,45-54,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5,5,5,5,14,1,"It has been a year ago since I started taking Ozempic. It was the final solution to a never ending problem with my blood sugar. I was already taking Metformin, Gliclazide and Invokana, but no matter how I tried to eat better, exercised, nothing was happening. My blood sugar was still rising. At one point my blood sugar went up to 11 and it has never been that high before. So my G.P. referred me to an Endocrinologist. The first thing he did was order a blood test and review all my medications. Finally, because I was taking the maximum dosage on all the other meds, he asked me to try Ozempic. At first I was hesitant because he explained that I had to inject myself once a week (and I hate needles), but that this was not insulin. He said try this medication or I’ll start you on insulin. I would rather try other medication before submitting to a life of insulin everyday.    He was very candid about the side effects of this medication, 3 to 6 weeks of uncomfortable side effects, but it will all go away eventually. He said if the side effects doesn’t go away after 6 weeks, to give him a call and he can change it to something else.  Well, I persevered, but I will be brutally honest to whoever will be reading this review, you will be miserable and sick and wished to God it would end. I had nausea, vomitting, headaches, lightheadedness, diarrhea, and so many other physical discomfort that I kept telling myself it will be all worth it. I was ILL, so ill that at one point I couldn’t get out of bed. So if you are willing to risk taking this drug, then make sure to take a leave of absence from your workplace because you will end up calling in sick A LOT! I was fortunate enough to be off work, so all the horrible side effects didn’t affect my job.     Ozempic is my saving grace. The journey was not easy, but my results are shown on my blood test and urine test. To date my A1C is 5.2 and I’ve lost 39 lbs.My diet went from CRAP to healthy."

Semaglutide,Ozempic,9/25/2019,Cornish Dowser,55-64,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5,5,5,5,24,2,"Having read many threads on this forum I havn`t read any from users who also suffer with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) so I thought it might be helpful to share my experience as I have had IBS since my late teens. I am 64 now. I started as most people do with a weekly injection of .25 mg to start my body to get used to Ozempic. I thought at first that I had no side effects. This was not quite correct though as I believed I was experiencing low level IBS which was not unusual for me. However I began to notice this was happening more often than usual. What actually seemed to be happening was that I was not having a direct side effect, but the Ozempic was actually triggering IBS events. This became much more obvious when I moved on to the next dosage level of 0.5 mg. The effects began between 24 and 48 hours and these were high level (severe) IBS events which lasted for 3 - 4 days when I got very severe stomach cramps constant diarrhea with fecal incontinence when sleeping requiring making a nappy out of a bath towel for at least 2 nights. On the 3rd week of the 3rd month the effect happened only hours after the injection. when I started the 4th month I had no IBS reaction, other than a few sulphur burps and this is how it has remained. It was a very unpleasant 3 months but I pushed on because of the promised benefits. Four months on and no unpleasant side effects. The results seem to be very good and I am really pleased that I stayed with it, I was getting near to the point of wondering if all effects were going to be worth it. So my advice if you also have IBS is stay with it as long as you can, for me it was hugely successful in the end, even though it was a very unpleasant road getting there."

Not much difference, in fact I have decided to stop taking Ozempic because of the severe diarrhea and nausea.  Yes A1C decreased but that is most likely because I was only able to eat about 800 calories a day.  I am a 57 year old male 5' 9"" and my weight dropped from 165 to 150 pounds.  I looked like a skeleton and had no energy or quality of life.  The loss of quality of life is a price I am not paying.  I have been off it for 3 weeks now and my appetite is back as is my energy and vitality.  Yes the medication does what it claims but be cautious of the horrific side effects.

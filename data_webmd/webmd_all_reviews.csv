The acid reflux was so bad it was trying to push the food back up again as I was trying to swallow. This stuff is terrible. I only took 2 injections then told my doctor that I flat out refuse to use anymore of this crap. Horrible experience.

I had many tests done by my GP, gyno and rheumatologist. Nothing. Then my NP put me on Semaglutide and my body is back to normal! I have energy and no more body stiffness issues at all within days of starting it. It’s a miracle! I have also lost 15 lbs in 3 lbs which is nice. But I don’t really need to lose much more. I hope I can stay on a lower dose to avoid going back to my issues. Only problem I’ve had is constipation. ButI takes prunes, Miralax and Emma capsules and that is helping a lot. Anyway, I wanted to share my story in case it helps others."

I was absolutely losing weight! I gave myself shots for around a year. About month 6, I landed in the hospital with extreme dizziness to the point that I couldn't stand to move. When I say extreme, I mean, it was like I was being swung around by my foot and tossed into outer space where there's no gravity and I was spinning every direction. I landed in the hospital twice. Once I had intestinal pain with diarrhea and bleeding. At the hospital they found that I had something going on with my intestine, directly where I had given myself the shot. Stopped using my stomach and started giving my shots only in my thighs. However, the dizziness continued to come back. The ER Dr. sent me to a neurologist and what they told me was I had BPPV. Being that I had never had this issue before, I just didn't see how it just started happening out of the blue. I tried ear canalith repositioning as per the neurologist instruction when I had the episodes. Unfortunately, when it happened I would be unable to function for a week at a time before it would subside. Then it started happening more regular. I stopped taking the Ozympic and reported it to my Dr. Never again!"

My 36 year old son was prescribed Ozempic by his doctor. My son was only slightly overweight but was hoping to shed a few pounds. After 3 months of use, he'd become lethargic, depressive, and was having suicidal thoughts, emotions he'd never previously experienced. He stopped taking Ozempic, but a month later ended his life by suicide. Our family, needless to say, is heartbroken over the loss of our wonderful son, brother, husband, and father.

Semaglutide,Ozempic,9/8/2024,Joanna,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,It's very effective from the beginning and in addition helped me to loose a lot of weight (50lbs in 3 months).
Semaglutide,Ozempic,8/27/2024,Notquitesureyet,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,3.6666666666666665,3,4,4,1.0,0,"I’m 63 and was diagnosed with T2 diabetes 2-1/2 years ago. I immediately went on the carnivore diet and lost 25#, and lowered my A1C from 6.8 to 6 and lowered my triglycerides from 333 to 98. I had more energy and felt decent with exception to joint pain from arthritis. 

I didn’t want to live this way indefinitely so I  transitioned to keto and then back to eating like a normal person and  slowly started gaining the wait back on. I gained 20lbs back on. 

My dietician told me that keto is the worst diet for diabetics and informed me that I should be eating 150g carbs every day. I don’t understand this at all because my BS is good when I eat less carbs and I don’t normally eat that many carbs in a day normally anyway. Not to mention you’re not going to eat that many on Ozempic anyway. Whatever…

My A1C crept back up to 6.8 so doctor suggested Ozempic. This is the only medication I take. 

I’ve been on Oz since mid May and I continue to have the same symptoms plus more as I have titrated my dose up to 1mg.

 My negative symptoms are nausea, fatigue,  constipation, feeling “off”, and for the first time woke up in the night feeling like I would vomit so was cuddling the toilet for awhile until it subsided and came out the other end. Not diarrhea either, very hard ?? and crampy. Sorry for the TMI. 
The severe constipation concerns me the most because I wonder if it’s making me feel ill (toxic?)and could lead to a blockage. I started taking miralax to help so we will see if it helps. 

I wanted to note some positive side effects that I’m noticing too. I have rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, I have had Lyme disease that has damaged my joints so I’ve dealt with a lot of inflammation for over 20 years but since taking Oz my inflammation has significantly reduced. My face and hands are no longer puffy. So this has been a pleasant surprise. 

My appetite is half of what it used to be and the longer I’m on 1mg(this is my second month in 1mg) I’m finally noticing that food noise quieting down. 

I’m also down about 12-13lbs. I would like to lose 20-25 more and I’m ok if it comes off slowly. I’ll admit that initially I was irritated that I wasn’t losing as fast as some have. But I’m severely insulin resistant (according to my doctor) so l should expect a slower loss. 

Some days I wonder if it’s worth the fatigue, constipation and feeling off every but some of your reviews have given me hope that in time these symptoms will subside. I’m thankful that my doctor isn’t titrating my dose up too fast either. I did .25 for one month, then a month at .5 and now  I’ll be on 1 mg for at least 3 months."

They gave me a huge dose of anti nausea meds and an iv and did acat scan. Prior to hospital visit, I had zero appetite, but I did not lose weight either!

I was on Trulicity for a year with the most awful digestive side effects including days and days of not being able to eat, constant pain and nausea.

Ozempic is A TOTALLY different experience. I'm on month 3.The injections are painless and easy. I've had next to no side effects until just the last few days and I don't even know if it's the Ozempic that's causing them. I have gastroparesis for years and it's comes and goes at times. It's been really annoying this past week and I hope it is unrelated to the Ozempic as we are moving me up to the higher dose next week. I cannot say if I've lost any weight but that's ok bc I lost so much with Trulicity and it's been delightful to actually be able to eat.

The best part is, my A1C is 5.0 and my average daily blood sugar is around 95."

 I Started this journey in May.  It took time to get labs.  They weren't totally forth coming about the Ulta Labs and fees. Which was my 1 ??.  Then once I was finally approved  The man I spoke with Siad I was approved for the highest dosage 2.5mgs.  I was told to start with ""units"" the 1st week, then up it 10 the 2nd week & then up/down 5 units each week until I get to where I need to be.  I finally received the medication  2nd ??is when the syringes come and are 1cc syringes and only marked by 10 increments called ""units"" and the vial doesn't hold 2.5 mgs.  When I email the man that I was working with on the phone with questions like what is the unit considered to be, how long before I get to 2.5 mgs, and why I was told it was  5 weeks worth of medication but the vial says to discard any medication 28 days after the initial puncture.  I never received a response so that to me was another ??.  So I called person wouldn't answer questions and was transferring me to a supervisor and the call dropped.  So I made several calls and finally got a different supervisor who explained 1 unit so each increment of 10 on syringe is .25 so at that rate it will take months to get up to 2.5.  This is a big ??as so many reviews of various companies say this is how they take your $$ & you don't see the weight loss because the dose is so low.  I feel like I've been deceived as I was told on my initial phone call of being approved that I would be given 2.5mg within 4 weeks.  The supervisor also told me to disregard the label that says to discard medication after 28 days from initial puncture. This is another ??to me because why would they put it on the bottle if they didn't feel it was necessary?   Would you be concerned?  Has anyone else experienced this?  I'm left here totally confused. I thought I was finally getting help for my weight issues but it feels like someone failed to be open and honest with me from the start. So I'm not sure what to do at this point.   Do I continue and see how it works or switch to another provider and start all over?  I hate to start over but I'm concerned with transparency.  I'd appreciate any recommendations!  I want to like the company but I feel like something is off. I was told 2.5mg but that is months away.  I know from the research that it is less effective and even ineffective at such low doses such as .5 so why would they start me at .25 and increase it at 5 units after the 2nd week. ?  I'm really confused and discouraged.  I wish I could attach photos of the vial and syringes."

I pay $365 for a two month supply thru my doctors office. After my first dose I lost 7lbs in 5 days and then I have been constipated for the past 3 days. I did not have any other side effects and for my 2nd dose I did 15ml instead of 10ml. I look forward to losing at least 30lbs in a month. Please understand I did change my eating habits. I have a protein shake for breakfast, Chicken wrap for lunch and chili or another protein shake for dinner. I walk at least 2 miles a day, one mile in the morning and another at night. As far as I'm concerned I will not spend money on something and still drink sodas, eating chips and other junk expecting the medicine to make the processed foods not sabotage myself by eating everything and anything under the sun.  This medicine however did not suppress my appetite to the point that I wasn't even hungry. It just assisted me in my weight loss journey. After my initial dose I did eat candy and still lost that weight. I wonder if I haven't would I have lost more? I stopped the junk food 2 days after my first dose.

Semaglutide,Ozempic,4/25/2024,Ashley,35-44,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,3.0,3,3,3,1.0,0,"I have struggled with binge eating and obesity since experiencing complicated trauma throughout my childhood and adolescence. I have been to therapy, seen a dietician, and tried many weight loss medications and diets over the years. I have lost and regained weight more times than I can count. I went on to further my education and am becoming a therapist myself because i thought becoming an expert would enanle me to get out of these cycles. Sure, ive learned alot but the physical aspect of hungeris hard. Also, I am pre-diabetic. The hunger urges and feelings associated with low blood sugar (even though I never read low) always do me in and I end up failing. Unfortunately, even pre-diabetic and with a BMI of 43, my insurance wouldn't cover gastric bypass. I lost, gained back, and lost again the same 30ish lbs multiple times over the past 5 years. After this last loss, I could feel myself wanting to quit and getting into a dark place of thinking, I'm never going to be able to maintain, so whats the point? Against my dietician's advice, I chose to try semaglutide through a local clinic at $500/month, out of pocket because, again, my insurance wouldn't cover it. After 7 months, I am down 43 lbs and am the lowest weight I've been since I had my 3rd child 13 years ago. More importantly, it has given me freedom from the constant obsessing over counting calories, macros, picking my diet plan, and weighing myself. I have never in my life felt ""normal"" around food before this. For the first time in my life I can walk away from food and not care. The weight loss has been very slow, which hurts given the cost of the medication. But, I truly feel free on it, and i feel like i can't put a price tag on that. While it has been ""life changing"" it only does part of the job.  I've had to choose to exercise, make healthy food choices, and be more overall active and health conscious. This just made it possible to start and maintain those habits. In the beginning months, I had some nausea, but I could live with it because I before I would often restrict and then binge until i was sick, so the type of nausea didn't make much of a difference. The worst part has been the constipation. I've had chronic bloat and diarrhea since I was a child. I thought constipation would be a reprieve, but really just a different variety of evil. I'm on maintenance now, so a shot every 2 weeks instead of weekly. I can tell when it wears off because my bowel habits go back to (my) normal and I'm hungrier. I have to work to keep the habits I've established. I also chose to switch to a whole food plant based diet a month ago which keeps me away from trigger foods (like cakes, donuts, muffins, and fast food.) I think this is also helping me to continue to lose .25-.5 lb/wk. Overall, I would recommend this to people who've struggled like I have. I'm 5'5"". My highest weight was 263. Starting on this med was 236. Currently 193."

Semaglutide,Ozempic,10/18/2023,DontBeScared,45-54,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,"Just wanted to share my Ozempic journey with you all. I've recently started on my fourth round of Ozempic, this tiny 0.25 dosage. Honestly, admitting that I have diabetes still feels weird, but hey, here I am.

I used to be on Metformin (500 mg) for a solid two years, and it was great until it suddenly stopped working. No matter how well I ate, my sugar levels were sky-high after meals, often hitting the 200s or 300s. If you're dealing with type 2, you know how awful that feels.

I made it clearto my doc that I didn't want insulin. I was open to any other solution, be it a diet change, lifestyle tweak, or new meds. When Metformin lost its charm, my doc suggested Ozempic. With my blood sugar all over the place, and being a 53-year-old, 6'1"", 260-pound guy, I was game to try anything.

I'll admit, I was a bit of a chicken about starting Ozempic. I read tons of reviews, and that didn't help my nerves. The pen sat in my fridge for two weeks until one day, my sugar spiked to 450 after having a small piece of sourdough bread with chicken soup. That was my breaking point. I finally jabbed the Ozempic into my thigh and went to bed.

The next day started fine, but I felt sicker than ever. Zero appetite. Weirdly, Diet Dr Pepper was the only thing that didn't make me want to puke. By day two, I was feeling better. The sickness faded, and it hasn't come back since. My appetite is practically nonexistent now. I mostly survive on different versions of chicken soup and the occasional handful of nuts. And don't worry, my evening White Claws survived the Ozempic invasion.

But here's the kicker – my blood sugar levels normalized within a week, maybe a bit too low at times. After years of dealing with crazy high sugar, I feel amazing. I've lost about 5 pounds in the last month, which feels pretty good. I'm about to up my dose to 0.5 and hoping for the best.

Honestly, Ozempic has been a game-changer for me. I'm sleeping better, feeling calm during the day, motivated to move, and no more naps. If my first month can inspire anyone out there to take that first shot, go for it. Yeah, it's scary, especially after all the scary stories you hear, but it could change your life. Don't be afraid to take the plunge. Cheers to better days ahead! ??"

Woke up every night with chest pains and an uneasy stomach feeling. I felt like I had the flu for 9 months. My skin ached, doctor told me it was a side effect of diabetes, not the meds. I stopped taking it and all the pains disappeared. It did keep my diabetes under 7 but the side effects were more than I could handle."

She said uncomfortableness would last a few days.

I immediately felt like I had Covid or the flu for 22 days. A slow recovery after. I was so sick to my stomach and had diarrhea or constipation so badly I did not eat an entire 22 days. The 22nd I knew things would start shutting down so I forced half of a banana down. The next day the same. I slowly was able to eat more butI couldn’t because my stomach was so incredibly ill and hurting the entire 22 days. Of course I lost 16 pounds those 3 weeks… but I would not quit and do it again. I was able to stretch my first pen with 0.25 and put it in my thigh starting the second week, I’ve since heard that as a recommendation. I cannot tell you the next 2 weeks were any easier. I’d have spells of fever at 103° and drank as much water I could. Probably 16oz a day. 1 glass. Forced. It felt horrible once I did but I knew I needed water. I probably should have gone to the er for fluids and nutrients.. if that’s possible. I was determined. I couldn’t get out of bed like sick unless I ran to the restroom. Absolute misery."

I too take ozempic and my reasons are a bit different. I have hypogycemia and was obese. The delayed digestion has been good for me. I used to get sick at my stomach and dizzy and have to eat all the time it seemed. I ended up at 195 and am about 5"" 8"". I am now at 148.  I have had side effects unlike my DD but have stuck with it and will. I also have very bad flat feet that have broken down over the years so I could hardly walk, was heading for a wheelchair. with weight loss, I can now get around so much better. By the way I am 77. My worst problem is constipation, I have always had a problem so nothing new. but it has been really bad, I have used Miralax, and enemas. I have worked on my diet to try to help and it has some. The main issue I had was overeating because of hypoglycemia and I also like to eat, LOL! and the wrong stuff. It got rid of a lot of cravings and I eat less, but most anything I want.  I can attest to the fact that if you eat to much you will get sick. In my case really sick, than I feel like I will vomit but don't. This has happened 4 or 5 times and I just quit eating to much, solved that problem. I also have gas, so I started taking a gas relief pill in the evening and stopped that. This is a good product, but like anything its no magic answer. You can't just take it and keep eating what you did and as much, it won't work and you will be sick. I too have never had to take more than .5mg per week. The last 2 months I've reduced to .25mg to help get rid of the constipation issue. I am still slowly losing some weight, hope to get to 145, but it has slowed down, which I expect. You have to work to make this medication work. Best thing that has happened for DD and I very pleased with the results."

It has been more than a year now and she weighs 125 and has a normal BMI and takes no other drugs for diabetes. She never had a shot larger than .50 mgand is still on it as her glucose and other levels are and have remained normal. This has been the best thing in the world for her.

I’ve been taking at the lowest dose .25 for almost 8 weeks. I’ve lost 15lbs. and all interest in food or alcohol. Not caring or even thinking about food or your next meal and not worrying about how you will resist food is incredibly freeing. The bad news is the side effects. After a shot, I feel so tired. Twice now I’ve had terrible diarrhea, which happened the two times I injected myself in the stomach instead of my thigh. Also had some mild nausea and horrible sulfuric burps. So far, it’s still worth it if the side effects can be managed but they’re no joke. I’m unlikely to increase my dose at this point bc I think the side effects would be unmanageable. Another downside is that it makes is challenging in some ways to change your diet bc I don’t want anything, much less extra veggies or a salad.

Dr B. said no relation (NR). then at month 23,I experienced severe stomach pain that lasted 24 hrs.  nothing otc worked. I notified Dr.B. “NR”. I did more research; it can effect & cause gallbladder, mood swings,liver, pancreatitis etc problems. I notified Dr.B, guess what; “NR”. I shot off a serious portal message to him. He ordered bloodwork & ultrasound. Bloodwork was fine; However, the ultrasound found gallstones & the same Dr recommended gallbladder removal! more research, gallbladder is important. I told him i want the medication that helps rid the stones or laser treatment. I’ve been referred to Hepatology. He still denies any relationship. Pay attention to your body, ask lots of questions, get response in writing. I’m off it for 3 weeks. My night munching has returned & craving sweets. Idk. i may return to a lower dose if gallstones can be removed w/o surgery. I will defer to Hepatologist. I NOW know I will gain back all my weight over time, per the Dr B.

It does seem to help control my appetite as I feel full after eating about half of what I used to at meals.  My concern is that my blood sugar numbers are out of whack.

My doctor took me off theglipizide and now my numbers have ranged from 108 to 211 in the morning.

Immediately had severe joint pains in both hands and knees.  It was so bad that it took pain pills to get through the day.  I tried to wait it out and see if my body adjusted but it was too debilitating.  I returned to my doctor and she took me off ozempic.  I am on predisone for a week trying to calm down my joints and then will try mounjaro if I can get it.  There is still a shortage of mounjaro out there even though my insurance coveredmost of it.  I didn't get to a high enough dosage using Ozempic to see if it even had an effect on my blood sugars.

Started at .25mg and increased to .5 for month 2 & 3. On .5 I started having acid reflux on day of injection. Took 1 Prilosec with shot and had no reflux. Started 4th month on 1.0mg. The really bad side effects started 3 days later after first dose of 1.0 mg. Almost constant belching of foul sulfurous tasting gas. Extreme bloating and abdominal pain, but no vomiting or diarrhea.However, I had what I can only describe as “splatter flatulence”, mostly mucus 10 to 15 times daily, usually triggered by eating 1 or 2 bites of anything. Day 3 & 4 I could make it to the bathroom, day 5 I couldn’t. That night things got so bad I almost went to the ER, but couldn’t get away from the bathroom. I’ve lost 23lbs some of which is due to side effects and not being able to eat.
   *GOOD NEWS!*  I found a cure for the side effects. One heaping Tsp. of Manuka Honey once or twice a day. Noticeable improvement immediately. By the 2nd day I was back to normal. I will not be taking Ozempic again. Google Manuka Honey for more info on healing properties. It’s even being used with surgical dressings to prevent infection (per article, which I have read, in The Journal of American Medicine). It doesn’t taste like regular honey but has an herbal flavor with sweet honey undertone. The taste may be off putting to some at first, but far better than the sulfurous burps which decreased immediately along with the other symptoms. I had some in my pantry that I had ordered from Amazon, but have since seen it in my grocery store. It is more expensive than regular honey, but I would pay triple for the healing effects. Research it and all will be explained including reason for higher price and various uses."

I lost more weight with Ozempic than having lap band surgery. If I inject more than 0.5mg each week I have nausea and lethargy.

I have been to an eye doctor and he couldn’t find any major issue with my eyes. As soon as I go off Ozempic my vision isback to normal.

Weight 267#. Started taking Farxiga and using both quick acting and long acting insulin. I cleaned up my diet and eliminated all sugar and processed foods, with a focus on veggies and white meat chicken. Stopped drinking alcohol and limited drinks to coffee, unsweetened iced tea and water. 3 weeks after leaving the hospital I was prescribed Ozempic. Took .25 for 2 weeks, then .5 for 2 weeks, then 1mg for 3 weeks, and just started taking 2mg today. Only side affect I have had is mild constipation. 4 weeks into taking ozempic my A1C fell to 11.2… at this time I stopped using my quick acting insulin with meals. 3 weeks later my A1C came back at 5.7…. My weight is currently at 224#.

To combat constipation I began consuming 2 cups of black coffee each day. Usually 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon. I didn’t like it black initially so I would add ice to it to cool it down so I could chug it fast. Over time I’ve come to like black coffe and enjoy it hot now. I also eat 1-2 sugar free greek yogurts each day. I’ve been doing this for 6 weeks or so now and I have little or no constipation. Oh, I also have found that if I fail to eat I become constipated so I feel that making sure I eat small food potions a couple times a day works. I also bought an Apple Watch and make sure that I walk 10k steps per day. That’s my journey so far with type 2. Hope my journey continues on this positive track."

I’ve eaten so little, andeven at that level I get explosive diarrhea, severe severe abdominal cramping from both gas and muscle convulsions, vomiting. It’s like my stomach is constantly tearing itself apart, even if the only thing I ate was 6 saltines. It’s basically been 4 mos of diarrhea, so I take Imodium and multiple gas x every single day. I’ve taken vitamin b6 and b12 as well as unisom to help with the nausea (same treatment course that helped my morning sickness). 
This med is wild and impacts people so differently. Most everything says .25 doesn’t do much, but I am the case study in that not being accurate. But feeling like a fork is twirling around my intestines like spaghetti isn’t a way to live. My last dose was 8 days ago and the last thing I ate was a dinner roll and banana 2 days ago and predictably I’m having horrific stomach rolling pain and diarrhea today. I can’t wait for this med to get out of my system."

In the 3 weeks I have taken it my blood sugars have gone from the mid 300 range to the mid hundreds range and I have lost 8 pounds. I love what it has done for me.
SADLY...after next week I will no longer be able to use it. In March I  was 64 and with my insurance  I  paid $25 a month. In April I am 65 and now have medicare with a  separate prescription insurance.  NowOzempic will cost me $579 a month and  the word ""medicare""  keeps me from  qualifying for a company reduction in cost.
So now I am one of America's elderly who no longer matter. I  shouldn't qualify for a medication that can help me live longer evidently. 
As far as I  am concerned Ozempic, companies like it, and medicare consider elderly throw away citizens!! We are the ones who really  need the savings plan but we are the ones who don't qualify. Good luck to each of you when you become one of us at 65!"

With a family history of diabetes and continued weight gain I was prescribed Ozempic in August 2022. My starting weight was 237 and now March 2023 I’ve lost 40 lbs. Yes, some mild side effects but ALWAYS due to eating a poor choice of food, in my experience. I read all the reviews before starting and was really worried so thought I would share my experience and how helpful Ozempic has been both in weight loss and insulin resistance. For me, the weight loss hasbeen gradual with some weeks showing nothing but have averaged 3-4 lbs per month. My cravings for sweets and snack foods has diminished although I do eat treats and lean into some mild cravings. I also seem to have lost my desire for red meat?!. Everyone has a different experience but all of my bad side effects were the direct result of eating greasy food/fast food/rich food/etc. Yes, there is some constipation but fibre made a big difference. My rings fit, I’m 4 sizes smaller, I sleep better, food is fuel not an addiction for me and the journey has been rewarding. I walk daily and try to make good food choices. Hope this help someone ??"

A little bit of back history first I am pre-diabetic and severely obese. I started with trulicity and lost 12 lb in 5 weeks, however I was having severe leg pains and I slept almost 24 hours a day.
 Then I was on victoza which I liked but I was gaining weight and I couldn't get past the lowest dose without feeling sick. I have severe IBS issues and both medications seem to completely eliminate the IBS that I normally experience. However the side effects and the sleeping was too much for me. 
Next I went on Rybelsus while I was waiting for Ozempic to be back in stock at my pharmacy. It is basically the pill version of the Ozempic. When I was finally able to fill Ozempic my doctor told me to take 5 mg because I'd already been Rybelsus however I only started with . 25mg. I had quite a bit of nausea along with IBS symptoms. The second week I took .5mg and I felt okay for the first couple days except for I felt like I had motion sickness. Then suddenly I was running to the bathroom with severe cramping and diarrhea along with vomiting at the same time. I literally could not eat anything for 3 days and like I mentioned I have lost 10 lbs in a week. By day 6 I started to get a little bit hungry but I'm still experiencing pretty bad cramping. The cramping feels like severe bloating which is just so uncomfortable. Seeing the number go down on the scale was exciting and I'm not sure that it's going to be worth all of this sickness that comes along with it or the triggering of my IBS. I have been unable to basically leave my house for days. I think that I will do today's injection as 0.25 mg and then in a couple days inject the other .25mg in hopes to ease some of the symptoms. I've been stuck at the same weight for so long that I'm just really hopeful that this will eventually subside and continue working on the weight loss and lowering my a1c. I can tell you that when I stopped the Rybelsus, I immediately gained weight back and I felt more hungry than I did before I started any of these medications. That is something I worry about, if I end up stopping Ozempic will I gain it all back. For now I just really need to work on the foods that I'm eating and changing my lifestyle and not just relying on the injection. I'm feeling very hopeful and excited at the possibilities of this medication can do for my overall health. Best of luck to everybody that's on it. I hope that you are able to succeed with whatever goal it is that you're reaching for."

It's been about a year now and my A1C went from 11 to 7.8. My labs were all perfect except my sugar still a little higher than where I need to be. Started with .25, then .5 and now I'm at 1 dosage. When I first started I got bad constipation. You don't eat much and I drank a lot less water then u used too which I think was the issue. That subsided. Occasionally I will get diarrhea from taking the meds now, its usually the day after if it happens. I have had those nast Sulphur burps people talk about but not often. Anytime I have stomach upset I use some Pepto and it goes away. I will probably stay at the 1 dose and work on my diet and exercise. BUT I lost about 8 pounds and my appetite is extremely reduced which I'm happy about. Having diabetes you feel hungry all the time because your body doesn't convert the sugar to energy. I can't tolerate metformin, terrible terrible diarrhea so Ozempic is like a miracle drug for me. Highly recommend it."

Semaglutide,Ozempic,2/6/2023,Stringa007,35-44,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,4.0,5,5,2,1.0,0,"I started out on 0.25 for 4 weeks. I had no side effects, lost a little weight. My first increase to 0.5 was fine, still no side effects and able to function as a normal person, at this point I was getting close to 30 pounds down. After 4 weeks, I was to increase my dose to 1mg. This is when the problems started...I've had bad reflux even with 40mg prescription Nexium, extremely painful stomach cramps, diarrhea (very bad, daily, about every 20-30 minutes, terribly disgusting sulfur burps, headache, weak/fatigue (likely from the inability to eat and barely drink liquids), if you do eat - you have to force yourself to eat because of the pain, dizzy spells (especially going from sitting to standing), stomach gurgles almost back to back all day, and did I mention how bad the diarrhea is? It's like giving yourself a virus that won't go away. I've taken the 1mg for 2 weeks now and can't tolerate this anymore. My doctor is putting me back down to the 0.5 dose as I had no side effects on that and took it for 4 weeks. However, the half life on this medication is very looooong, which means even though I have taken my 0.5 dose, it'll take a few weeks before anything balances out. My blood sugar levels have been so good it is unheard of. So far, I have lost 40 pounds but not without ridiculous amounts pain, did I mention the back to back diarrhea (don't leave home), and about 13 pounds of my weight loss came from the 1mg because you are so sick you don't want to eat or drink anything. Also, on the 1mg, you might want to just throw out your daily coffee or caffeine intake altogether as it makes it unbearable. Occasionally I will take ibuprofen for the stomach pain and does help (a little). I missed 2-3 days of work since going on the 1mg but thought I actually had a stomach bug until it was daily for the last 2 weeks. I am hopeful that going back to the 0.5 will stable me out. I love my BS numbers, and the weight loss is something I've never been able to accomplish (and haven not been this small since I was in my 20's (currently 38 years old). I'm actually able to fit into WAY smaller clothing and have even enjoyed shopping a little more. I have read in the comments about a lot of people feeling depressed after taking the medication. I have not noticed this, however, I have been on an antidepressant (Lexapro) for years. I could, however, see how this medication could make you depressed if you consistently experience the side effects that I have on the 1mg dose. Fingers crossed that going backwards will return me back to normal. Also, you may want to put 4-5 layers of underpants on when you go to sleep, trust me, to be on the safe side...did I mention diarrhea? If you can tolerate the smaller dose, stick to that, I personally do not recommend going to 1mg (the devil reared his head from the bowels of my stomach). Aside from wishing I never went to the 1mg (and perhaps being malnourished and dehydrated from upping the dose, I would recommend it but only to the level your body can tolerate it otherwise you will have zero quality of life. I functioned just fine with no side effects at 0.5 but still enjoyed the weight loss, 1mg will never happen again!"

I had tried metformin  but it did help. My Dr suggested Ozempic and mentioned it was not for the faint ofheart.

My first .25 injection was in the stomach, the side effects came on strong, the next day, nausea, acid reflux, sulphur burping, throwing up bile, and loose bowels. 

It has not been easy, in terms of side effects but I now inject in my thigh and they are more manageable and have diminished in severity and occurrence.

A bland diet, has been working best, I make smoothies with protein powder, fruit and unsweetened almond milk 3 times a day. 
Meat has been hard to stomach, so has cheese, pasta, or anything heavy.

Grateful this is working!"

Yes This stuff works excellent for curbing your appetite. I only eat like once a day because I'm not hungry at all. Finally after 35 years of battling overeating and food cravings, something finally stopped all that. I felt like I was a normal person.

Started Ozempic for weight loss on November 8th after hitting an almost all-time high weight of 236.  I just took my 9th dose this morning and am down 17 lbs.  Its always been hard for me to lose weight without incredible amounts of exercise or near starvation, so i am pleased.

So whats the journey been like?  At the .25 starting dose, all was well till between week 2-3 when i had about 2 1/2 days of aggressive diarrhea (essentially liquid form and almost uncontrollable).  Probably 20 times in that period. (That side effect led me to a blog like this where someone said they found less trouble when taking the shot in the leg vs the stomach.  I had taken the first two in the stomach and immediately switch to the leg for shots 3-9.  I have no idea if it actually helped or if my body just got used to the medicine - but i do know i wont be doing any more shots in the stomach. :))  Thankfully, in the 6 weeks since, ive only had that one time again.  Like some others, with my first ever dose i had no idea if i got any or not.  But alas, it seemed to work out.  After this initial box of .25, i was upgraded to a box of .5.  As the .5 box came to and end, my doctor was going to keep me at .5 for another cycle, but it was impossible to get the medicine at that dose so i successfully urged him to take me to 1.0.  This morning was my third shot of 1.0.  In the last two weeks i have a new symptom, with is mild vertigo.  Usually mostly in the morning after getting up quickly or after consuming sugar.  I can deal with it though, i just try to stay aware of it and what causes it.  Good luck to you all!"

The biggest downside to this has been the nausea which is not nearly as bad as it was but I still have to use nausea medication within a week after my injection.

I remember noticing in the first 2-3 months of taking Liraglutide that my appetite went down and I did loose some weight.  But after that period my old appetite returned and so did my weight (180 +15 lbs).
When the study I was on for liraglutide was over I switched to Ozempic (about a year ago) The A1C numbers actually improved and my weight went down similar to the liraglutide.  However, after 1 year, I still maintain the 10-15 lb drop in weight and my appetite is similar to when I started on the medication!  For me, absolutely no side effects.  A matter of fact my ischemic heart condition seems to have improved too (physically I can do more exercise)  Thus for me, a 76  year old male, I can't say enough good for the medication!"

It screwed my kidneys! I took it for 3 years, my numbers were always in range irregardless, she told me it would help lose weight, hogwash! I changed my diet (to the zone) and lost 60 lbs. I quit taking all my diabetic meds as I felt so good. I weaned my self off this garbage and my doctor said I would gain all my weight back! Nonsense! I have even lost more weight! The whole time I was on this drug I felt it playing with my kidneys. Understand my numbers were never to the point of causing kidney problems and I know there’s more to it than that.

Everything I eat I burp up great feeling. I am not using  Ozempic to take off weight but it sure has done that. I just want to eat like a normal person again and have my life back. I can barely bike 10 miles I am burping most of time. This stuff should not be on the market. Save yourmoney if you want to take off weight just stop eating because that’s all ozempic is going to do for you. Stock up on loperamide and adult diapers you will need them. Pepto for the sulfur burps. I am not using Ozempic again I am not able to keep my high blood pressure meds in me.  Again stop eating, loperamide, pepto and most importantly ADULT DIAPERS!!

I can’t believe it. I am at 1mg and having spouts of nausea and vomiting. I also have heartburn but it subsided. I am still learning what I can and cannot eat. If I have too much food it sits in my stomach I wind up throwing up. In the morning I am the most nauseous. Coffee makes me more nauseous. But this medicine does work! It reduces your appetite where it makes you conscious of what you are eating. You must limit your eating to small portions.

I am down 65 lbs in 7 months to 173lbs. The medication was so effective that I stayed on .25mg and then .5mg for longer than typical and have been on 1.0mg for 6 weeks. No negative symptoms for me. I've had hypoglycaemic symptoms (low blood sugar) since I was a teenager (I'm 52), but no medical tests would affirm this. Since taking Ozempic these lows are now gone, and I cried because now I finally know what just being hungry feels like. I am paying close attention to hunger cues now as my trigger to eat. I don't eat a lot in a day, but the food tastes better to me than pre-Ozempic. I feel so much better - arthritic knees don't hurt, inconvenience gone, congestion improved. I have gone from a size 20 jeans to a 10. I know my results are not typical, but for me it is an absolute miracle drug."

It was given to me for two reasons. One to help me manage my sugars better and to help me lose weight. But personally it did not help me lose weight but it did help me bring my A1C from 6.0 to 5.9. My A1C was at 6.0 before I started Ozempic. I started to use this medication somewhere in July or August of 2021, and had to stop it July of this year because I have gallbladder stones and my doctor said Ozempic is known to cause that. 
Now here is where my worry and question comes in, I question how dependent does your body become on this medication. I say this because I stopped it like I said July of this year and my sugars were ok and my A1C in August was 5.9 but November came and my A1C spiked to 7.2. How and why did this happen in 2 or 3 months? I know I was in prediabetic range but I could probably expected a rise maybe of 6 or 6.1 but 7.2? So now they said I am diabetic. 
So has this happen to anyone else? I also am going to get my gallbladder stones checked and see if I don't need surgery. Thanks Ozempic."

I also have high cholesterol but has been unaffected by my weight loss or gain (I have weighed from 52kgs up to 70kgs with no chance, also have been vegan for 7 years with no change - so I'm not hopeful here). Relatively easy to use although the syringe system is a bit fussy and having to buy the higher doses as the lower ones are unavailable in my country, and then adjusting the syringe hasn't been simple. First time I took it, in the evening and could not sleep that night, also very badly for the following 5days. Have returned to normal now. Very strong appetite supressant effects the first five days (on 0.25) then fell to relatively normal appetite again, so I was quite stressed. On my second dose, no 'nervous feelings' but the appetite suppressant effect has stronly diminished - I just don't feel like snacking, but can eat otherwise normal meals. Had diarrhea the first couple of days, nothing since. No palpitations, no nausea, no constipation, maybe a little more gas than usual. Have taken my third dose now, same feeling - no side effects but only a minimal appetite suppressant effect, let's say 20% less which is still great, but not as reported by others (not being able to eat fatty foods, not feeling hungry at all). Maybe I should up my dose."

It’s certainly not immediate, but within 10-14 days you notice a significant reduction in cravings. By the 3rd week, I was having to convince myself to eat. I have been on every medication out there to reduce my appetite (Wellbutrin, phentermine, topiramate, etc), but nothing has helped except Ozempic. The first few doses definitely caused side effects like headache, nausea, general malaise and discomfort. I almost gave up because the side effects were overshadowing the weight loss, but eventually I got accustomed to it. This certainly works so I wouldn’t hesitate to try it."

I had to go online to figure out how to use this and even when I was online watching it on YouTube I thought it was unnecessarily complicated. I’ve taken a dose, I think, except I never felt a needle go in so I’m hoping I got the medication in me but I’m not at all sure. There’s also no information that the pen will check it self back down to zero when you’ve used a dose, not that I would be able to see it.  Again I’m not sure I got a dose, but thepen did click back down to zero, which just may be a quark of the pen it’s self
I use a pen to control my cholesterol. You have a pen, you put it on your skin, you hit the button, you’re done. It’s as easy as pie and this pen is absolutely not.

It's been an interesting journey, I definitely lost weight, about 18 LBS over this time period, but I also have to say that I do not enjoy my meals as much as I used to before starting the medication. That said it is highly effective in what it is supposed to do. 
A lot of doctors might be reluctant to prescribe it for weight loss because technically only Wegovy is approved for weight loss by the FDA. 
It took me a while to find somone to prescribe Ozempic, but currently getting it from QuickMD. Wegovy is backordered anyway, so cannot get it even if I was willing to pay the additional price for it. 
Speaking of, the reason I am not fully satisfied with it is the crazy high price, about 900 a month for Ozempic."

It's been approximately 3wks since I last reviewed, and I said I would update as I'm not feeling as enthusiastic. I've been on the higher dose of 0.5mg for 3wks and I'm feeling quite ill most of the time. My tummy is upset every morning, I have nausea every day, and I'm vomiting every couple of days it seems. I can't understand why I've been vomiting but I can only think it might be due to the food having a slow-release from the stomach and anything that hasn't had a chance yet to digest, goes bad and therefore you've no choice but to vomit. I've also noticed that my libido is now non-existant. I've read reviews on other websites and it looks like I'm not the only person experiencing this. This isn't listed as an official side effect so maybe the side effects list needs to be updated? As a result of the always feeling ill, I've become house-bound because I no longer have the energy to go for walks and meet up with friends and I know this is very unhealthy. Anyway, I'm going to give myself another week of this and, if things don't improve, I'm going to ask my doctor to reduce the dosage back down to 0.25mg for the foreseeable.

I have had so much trouble losing weight over the last 10 years.  This medicine has been a gift for me.  My cardiologist prescribed this for me and it has worked like a miracle.  I have lost about 10lbs so far and Im in my 6 week.  Side effects included nausea only.  I power through it because I see and feel the results.  Best of luck to everyone and Health.

I can hardly eat anything as I feel full all the time (bloated) but happy with that as I really want to loose weight. 
I did feel as tho I was pregnant but I deff not at the age of 61 lol with all the symptoms. Also I cannot drink alcohol, the thought of it want to make me be sick.
The upside is I am loosing weight !"

When I started .50 mg., I began experiencing lightheadedness, heart racing with palpitations and weakness. Went to the emergency room and the said I had orthostatic hypotension which is when you go from standing to sitting your body drops more than 20 pts. Told me to stop taking Ozempic immediately. Come to find out orthostatic hypertension occurs to 10% of people taking this. That’s a pretty high percentage and should be listed openly (not in small print) as a possible side effect. Stopped taking the weekly shot and the bp is back to normal as is the heart rate. If you take it, be aware this could possible happen to you. I did regulated my insulin and lost weight in the 4 months I took it, but it’s not worth it to me to continue this."
Semaglutide,Ozempic,9/20/2022,Ozempic,25-34,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,"I am based in Ireland and Ozempic is €150pm here, or free if you have Diabetes. I don't have diabetes so I pay €150pm. I know the Govt are trying to reduce the price because Ozempic is half the price in France and Poland! 

I am on my fifth week of using Ozempic. The first four weeks, I was on 0.25mg, and now I'm on 0.5mg. I will increase to 1mg in a couple of weeks and stay on that for the foreseeable. 

I have lost 14.5lbs so far and I am ecstatic about that! I have PCOS and so it's been verydifficult for me to lose weight the traditional way but Ozempic makes it so easy for me. I have been feeling quite ill every morning. It starts in the early hours of the morning and lasts right through until about 10am. That's nausea, acid reflux, and an upset tummy. In the two days since increasing the dose to 0.5mg, I have been feeling these side effects a bit more. I read loads of the reviews below where some people were saying the experienced fecal incontinence. I thought I was lucky because I hadn't had that side effect since I started taking Ozempic but I actually experienced this for the first time this morning. A bit embarrassing! But, I think taking everything into consideration, it's not enough to deter me from continuing to take Ozempic. Seeing the reductions on my scales is enough to make me want to continue. 

To try and reduce the side effects, my doctor advised that I eat as low fat as possible because it's the fat the exacerbates the side effects. She's right because I can see the difference between if I eat really low fat vs. a ""normal"" meal. 

My starting weight was 260lbs and I'm 5ft 6.5"". My current weight is 246lbs and I'm feeling so much more confident in myself. My husband and I are taking a trip to Vienna in a month and I look forward to finally being able to take a proper photo of the both of us without worrying about what I look like! Yes, Ozempic can be expensive, but the confidence I now feel is priceless :)"

My starting weight was 202 lbs and I am 5'4""
I am now at 176 lbs.

I started at the .25 dose for two weeks and went up to .50 only after two weeks.
Next week I am going up to 1 mg weekly dose.
I felt slightly neauseaus at first but gravol helped with that.
I still carry around the gravol ginger shews and eat a few of those when I feel slightly nauseous. 
Gravol helps!
Aside from a slightly upset stomach, my only other complaint has been remembering to not eat too much!
When I eat too much, I don't feel well, and the one time I ate way too much, I vomited...

My typical day of eating is one boiled egg and coffee with cream for breakfast...one cup of salad and a about 2-3 oz protein for lunch and a small dinner like half a chicken breast and a few pieces  of broccoli.
If I eat more than this I feel crappy.
Sometimes I only have a cup of popcorn for dinner....
It is amazing how little I care about food now that I am taking Ozempic once a week.  
This medication has been my saving grace and I recomend it to anyone needing to loose weight."

Noticed weight loss a week or so in. Continued weekly for 4 weeks, then went to 1/2 unit. Ongoing weight loss and eating a smaller portion makes hungry feeling go away so less food intake. Switched to 1 unit after 8 weeks. Had ""heavy transit"" for one day during week 9, then normal again. Also, in the same week, i had a really bad day = feeling very sleepy and skin that was feeling sensitive. Weight loss from day one tillSept 16 = 26 lbs. The weight loss in my case is like a seesaw it will be at a certain weight for 3,4 days or so, then go down a pound, then stay again for 3,4 days then go down again liek a seesaw stock market situation. My blood glucose numbers have dramatically gone down, monitoring with CGM. Following this development, some other diabetes indicators such as pain in hands and feet have disappeared without flare ups.

The side effects (GI upset, fatigue, brain fog) can be devastating. I do believe the manufacturer recommendations regarding timing of step up doses, for most, is optimistic at best. But, here's the thing; there is no set standard, or real medical necessity, for the manufacturers step up dose timing. It is entirely possible to stay at the 0.5 mL dose for longer than a month if needed withno ill effect. My doctor agreed and prescribed me the 1.0 mL dose and recommended very incremental increased dosing. Just because you have a 1.0 mL pen, doesn't mean you have to use the entire 1.0 mL dose. From the 0.5 mL dose, I stepped up to 0.6 mL, then 0.7, 0.8, etc. This absolutely helped manage side effects and allowed a far more realistic adjustment period than the manufacturers recommended jumps of 0.25 to 0.5 to 1.0 mL."

I started at the lowest dose of .25mg and then moved up monthly. I'm currently at 1mg and will be moving to 2mg next week. I'm so pleased with this medication. I've lost approximately 35lbs so far. I've been on a strict diet and also go to the gym when I can, as well. But, I attribute most of the loss to this drug because nothing was moving the needle, until I started using it. I have barely no appetite and have to force myself to eat. I never really realized how much my life revolved around food until I didn't depend on it for comfort anymore. The only side effect I have is constipation, which I take stool softeners for. You can't expect to eat large meals with this and feel well. You really have to pretend like you just got bariatric surgery and can only digest small portions and nothing heavy. I feel this is why a lot of people report getting sick with GI issues. They continue to eat like usual. This MUST be a full lifestyle change to be effective and if you can power through some of the side effects and make the necessary healthy changes, you will be so pleasantly surprised. This changed my life for the better and I feel like a new person."

Then I started to have weird side effects such as heavy menstrual bleeding with clots, so long and heavy that I had to go to OB GYN to start oral contraceptives to stop the bleeding after 30 straight days of bleeding. OBGYN did ultrasound and said that I shouldn’t be bleeding as my endometrial tissue was very thin. 
I have had very low blood pressure reading of 80s/60s, calf cramps, and a random frozen shoulder that I had togo to orthopedics for. Never these issues before starting medication. Very bizarre.

A1c of 6.2.  I am taking Ozempic as a first line treatment for the impending diabetes and the obesity.  I have other issues related to auto-immune disease such as hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis, and IBS.  I also have asthma, elevated cholesterol, and high blood pressure.

The first thing I noticed about taking Ozempic is that my IBS was immediately relieved but I started getting mood swings and irritability.  The effectof 0.25mg wore off within 3 days and I immediately got rebound diarrhea and felt lethargic.  After increasing to 0.5mg per week, the effect lasted 5 to 6 days and then began the IBS rebound and feeling bad.  On 1mg per week, everything seems normal and I only loose control of my appetite on the 6th and 7th days, no other effect noticed.

This medication actually makes me feel normal at a full dose.  I have a bowel movement every 36 to 48 hours and have good control over my eating habits.  The only thing I have a hard time giving up are the grains, especially wheat, that seem to cause a lot of inflammation in my body.  I notice that I feel good when I especially avoid wheat. But sadly, I like bread a lot.

The hardest thing to get over is psychological dependency on eating as a way to find happiness in life and to deal with my emotions.  I am free to enjoy other things now besides eating.  My whole life seemed to revolve around eating and the planning of meals.

My experience seems to be different from others I have read here but I hope this helps.  God bless you all."

I’ve been on it long enough to take 5 once-a-week doses now,  four at 0.25 and one at 0.5. Each week, I’ve had different side effects. The first week, there was mild nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and exhaustion, Second week brought stronger nausea to the point of vomiting. Doc prescribed something for it, but it didn’t really help. Third week, the nausea went away, but there was severe constipation. Fourth week, I had sharp abdominal pains (probably due to the continuing constipation) and some dizziness. Fifth week (upped dose to 0.5), I had the first migraine that I’ve had in years, along with more nausea again, and still with the constipation.

The reason that I’ve stuck it out this long is because the doc and my mom (who has been on this med for a while) told me that the side effects would dissipate and the weight loss would be worth it. I was also told that I would lose interest in eating and I would feel full almost all of the time. Neither has been true for me. I still have the same late-night snacking urges that helped me put on the weight. The only thing that I’ve noticed is that I can’t eat as much, because I start feeling nauseous after eating about half of what I used to. The bad thing about that, though, is that I had a sleeve gastrectomy, so I was already eating about half of what a non-sleeved person eats.

I plan to try to stick it out until my next A1c (which was 9.3 at my last appointment), to see if it makes any change there. If it makes enough of.a difference there and I do actually see a dissipation of side effects, then I’ll stay on it. If the A1C doesn’t come down significantly, then I don’t see a point to the suffering that this medicine is causing me."

Manage it with pepcid and omeprazole; drink cold water.  YOU MUST EAT HIGH QUALITY PROTEIN AND VEGETABLES.  You will want to eat less, make sure it's proper building blocks.  I lost all sugar cravings! down 10 pounds in 6 weeks. Get your walking or biking in - read the insert!  do the 150 minutes per weeks exercise.  Ozempic works to support changes I have been making, nothing is a miracle cure - but this one helps nudge all your work in the right direction - you will lose weight.  If the nausea gets bad eat a graham cracker, use ginger ale with sugar.  Don't be afraid of foods any longer - just eat better since you will not feel like eating much.  Start tracking your calorie intake - you will be amazed.  If you are not motivated to lose weight then don't use the medication."

I was very dehydrated. I went and seen my GI Doctor, she did some tests on me and my white blood cells were high, my potassium low, she actually called it Anorexic. After 5 months I'm happy that I've lost 40 lbs, but all of the symptoms are still there. I've missed way too much work. I have one more dose in my pen for 1.0 mg that I'm not going to take.

Started ozempic at .25 doses... did this for 2 weeks...typical side effects (sleepiness, nausea and direahea) stayed at .25 for 2 weeks.

Woot woot! 20ish pounds in about a month. I am super happy and hope this continues. 

I am noticing that I'm barely eating.. like I'm technically anorexic based on my calorie intake... I'm just not hungry and if I do eat it's cramps and direahea.... I've also had a few instances lately were I felt something like hypoglycemia shock.. that is scary of course but when this happens I just eat some chocolate or something and I feel better. ?? 

I'm curious if anyone else has similar side effects?

I know those side effects might seem harsh but really I'm feeling pretty normal most of the time and the weight loss makes up for it!

Also my dog said I wouldn't even lose weight in the first 1 to 2 months as this is time for your body to get used to medicine and for the medicine to build up in your system, so I was very surprised to be losing weight immediately.

Having to take Metamucil for diarrhea then sometimes I’m constipated for days. I have Medicare part D and have been on ozempic for about 5 months and now I’ve used up all of my prescription money for the year so having to pay full price for all of my medication. My doctor did fill out a form with ozempic and they are going to give me 4 free months thank goodness because I cannot afford it. I’ve only lost 12 pounds since I’ve been on it and get very nauseas after taking it. It’s working though so I’m happy. It’s frustrating though that other insurance companies pat ask but $25 and people on Medicare have to pay a fortune. I still think Medicare, deductibles, prescriptions etc should be free. People never work a day in their lives get free Medicaid we work and still have to pay. Good luck to all of those on it because for me it’s slowly working. I move up to 2mg next week."

I’m insulin resistant, obese on glycemic chart, always showed high glucose on blood work. Diabetes is hereditary in my family. I did ALL the diets . Started WW at age 12. Lost weight yes slowly plateaus for months and months then I’d eat and gain back the weight. A friend told me about metabolic clinic through our hospital and she had tremendous success. I was psyched!
I qualified for the rx and my insurance paid for a lot of it but I paid $190. A syringe which lasts 6 weeks.
Painless injection. 
So nauseous like most here. Urge to eat gone. Maybe too gone. I couldn’t eat. Was losing weight like crazy and that felt great. My dx prescribed zohran which is a life saver for me.( 4 mg maybe once a day or 5 days out of 7).
After a month I was supposed to go up to .50 but .25 was working and finally I was able to eat a little because not eating isn’t the way i
Wanted to go. My doctor said if 2.5 is working stay on it so that’s what I did it’s been about almost 3 months and I’ve lost 22 pounds I feel great weight wise but the nausea continues here and there. My doctor said to watch the carbs and sugar because that could activate the nausea and when I did that I less nausea but the thing is I really don’t want to give up things like watermelon, blueberries and some other fruit. So I’ve been staying on .25 and it still helps me to tell me when I’m full I’m still eating a fraction of what I used to eat and the good part other than the weight loss is that my blood pressure medication has been cut in half and then actually then cut in half again so for me that’s fabulous to have those meds tapered my heart doctor is thrilled with weight loss and she’s OK with this Way to go to lose weight I’d to have questioned whether I wanna keep living like this in order to stay sinner or less fat and I don’t know how long I can do this it’s a nausea doesn’t ever subside . Many days I feel just fine so I really have to probably start watching what I’m eating to see what the reaction is and I’m finding that if I eat watermelon at night and I feel fine I don’t feel fine the next morning I am so thankful for this medication and somebody finally addressing the fact that we overweight people need some help as well I plan on going back to Weight Watchers only to get the camaraderie and I’d like to listen to the strategies of a diet plan. sometimes though I’m so tired I can’t exercise it’s weird I have normal days and then days where I’m just really tired. My doctors are taking blood frequently and keeping eyes on what’s going on which makes me feel good I don’t blame anybody for not being able to continue on this medication because it is a little rough but if it’s not that bad it’s a miracle drug I wish it wasn’t so incredibly expensive and The drug manufacturers would stop overcharging us crazy prices if you find that your pen doesn’t deliver the correct amount you can contact them which is what I did when my pen didn’t give me the correct doses and they actually gave me a coupon for a free pan which was great because it cost me $190 a pen they said they would send me an envelope to get the pan to see what’s wrong with it but I waited for weeks and they never sent it so I threw out the pen . One thing I don’t understand is the pen clearly states that after six doses even if you have more medication left in the pen you must throw it out I don’t understand why especially since it cost so much money why that’s something that you have to do it makes me feel like maybe the company is just trying to get more money out of us and of course that’s not right."

My doctor tiered the dosage from .25 mg for 4 weeks, then .50 mg for 4 weeks, then increased to 1 MG for the remaining time. I've just gone in for a check up, and increased to the 2 mg dose beginning this week. 
Each dose I experienced some stomach knots, but they resolved after the first day of the adjustment. I did initially have some very mild nauseum but all I needed to do, was take a sip of cold water to take care of it. I stress, the nauseum was very verymild. I do have a bit of constipation, but I balance with stool softeners and strict keto (high fat). 
I've lost 21 pounds to this point and this medication is the first thing that's controlled my appetite. I used to feel hungry all the time but now I don't feel like I need to eat all the time. I don't snack all the time like I used to.
I was doing everything I was supposed to, I was working out and strict keto. But, I was stuck and couldn't lose any more weight. The medical community doesn't treat obesity like a medical condition, they just look at us like we can't control ourselves and we're lazy.

I approached my weight loss doctor about the possibility of using Ozempic/Wegovy for weight loss (I have a BMI of 38, 240Lbs at 5' 4""). I have been on it for 4 months now with tremendous results. I have tried many other plans, including every diet imaginable, WW, Gastric Banding, Gastric Bypass, etc, with temporary success. But nothing would ever remove the feeling of being ""hungry"" and wanting to binge. Ozempic has done the trick. 

Yes, there are side effects that can be uncomfortable. If you are nauseous, ask your doctor for Zofran (an anti-nausea medication that really works). If you have gas, use simethicone 250mg. 

I realize I may need to remain on this for the rest of my life, but that is a small price to pay to reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes & stroke, which all run in my family. Thank you, Novo-Nordisk!"

Besides the occasional bout of nausea and fatigue when moving up a dose, it’s been fine thus far, apart from my most recent dose change. I took the .5 for 5 weeks, since on the fifth week I didn’t have access to the 1 mg pen yet, and I took my first dose of 1 mg just the other day and I have been violently ill since. I just wish there was a .75 mg marking instead of it being strictly a 1 mg pen, because doubling your dose like that really sucks. I’ve gagged countless times, can’t stay fully upright for long due to stomach problems, appear to have gastroparesis, and nearly all the contents of my stomach are liquefied, but haven’t passed on to the intestines yet. I’ve also had gas pain through the roof and also have burped a lot more than normal, despite me having GERD regardless of the Ozempic. Because of the nausea, that burping nearly makes me throw up every single time. I’ve been stuck in a recliner unable to move because of surgery before, and had a laparoscopic gallbladder removal, but nothing has ever really affected me this bad, apart from COVID-19. I’m seriously considering going to the emergency room if this doesn’t let up. The 1 mg pen also isn’t near potent enough; because of the sheer volume of the 1 mg dose, it pooled in the injection site and was extremely uncomfortable.

I started with the usual .25 dose for 4 weeks and it didn't do anything in terms of weight loss or for hunger. I felt mild symptoms, mostly just tiredness but nothing too terrible. When I increased the dose to .50, the tiredness increased as well and I felt a little discomfort at times, but again nothing major. I did not lose any weight and it did not help with hunger. I am now on my second week at the 1.0 dose and my hunger is completely gone. I have no cravings for food and I find that I am for needing my tell myself to eat. I started a low calorie diet(Noom) on June 01/22 as well, and I am happy to say that in since then(17days ago) I have lost 13lbs. I think the combination for Ozempic at 1.0 dose and the low cal diet is the magic wand and is working for me. I have bouts of dizziness, still very tired but the lbs are melting off almost effortlessly. I encourage people to give it some time and press on through the ill effects, it gets better and I have much hope that this medication will help me towards my goals in weight loss. Good luck all, hope this helps?? 
I will try to post in the future with updates."

Just dosed 8th week on Wed.  First four weeks 2.5 now using.5.  Only problems I experienced at .25 was moderate bloat and foul burping.  Did not lose weight or experience any nasty nausea or constipation.  Past four weeks at .50, drastically different effects and results.  So nauseaus, throwing up frequently, like 2-3x per day, bad constipation which leads to more vomiting.Or if i begin to heat up and start sweating.

I've read enough of these reviews to know what can occur so I'm roughing it out until my follow up next week with my Dr.  I've lost ~15bs these past four weeks.  My blood sugar went low for the first time in my life so I've discontinued Humalog 20 units x2 daily and I'm testing good range glucose-normal for 2 weeks now. Dr also took me off Januvia to start so I'm taking .50 ozempic and Jardiance only now.  Honestly I don't think I can keep this up unless the nausea and tiredness subsides which I hate to think of stopping since it is working.  Just some nasty nausea and constipation, very little appetite. My urination has drastically been reduced, too. I've read where people say that's because the sugar isn't needing to be flushed as frequently frequently and I know I'm not drinking enough water because I'm always full."

My headache came back today -maybe because I ate a heavy-sugar snack?  As others previously mentioned, I have that ""weird"" feeling in my tummy. lol, it's not even something you can identify with to be honest, it's just weird. The feeling of not needing to eat is there, the mental part is the difficult part- I KNOW that Nanaimo bar tastes good... do I really want it-- or just recall that it tastes good.. weighing in whether to tackle it or not...yet side tracked in any way takes me away from the memory of good food. So that's good!
Gas-- yes biggest gassy noises ever- glad I can go outside quickly to pass. Needle is not worth mentioning- simple, no pain, just sit on skin, press button, count and release. Simple. 
I do not know of it's effectiveness yet, however I know my daughter lost 16lbs in two weeks. The cost is not covered for me, but it is so important for me to take the weight off my knees that it's worth scrimping for- plus I will buy less goodies! Win-win. I will touch base as my body decides what it's going to do.. Way too many diets, too silly to have surgery and risk my life- this could be a real God-send to so many of us that have been on the yoyo dieting train for too many years to count! Good Luck to all."

It’s like someone turned a switch on in my brain that was accidentally shut off. I now feel full after eating even half a sandwich or a small bowl of oatmeal. I can’t actually believe it because it’s so strange to just be able to walk away from food because I’m full. I don’t think I’ve felt this since I was a child. I’ve lost about 7 lbs. I have definitely experienced some vomiting but mostly at night which is similar to what I had from reflux. Definitely had some constipation and the burps are miserable- but again with my weight gain I had terrible reflux so I was sort of used to it- I’m praying it keeps working because I finally feel like I can have a normal relationship with food.

Took one injection at LMC and took the second at my home.  Really back diarrhea and then stomach pains.  Stopped taking the injection because I felt worse than ever.  Two weeks or so later I broke out into a rash and welts all over my body.  Doctors at LMC said it was psoriasis and had nothing to do with the Ozempic.   I am 73 years old.  Psoriasis at my age?  Really?  Then my family doctor referred me to a dermatologis who said not Psoriasis but performed a biopsy to be sure.  Lab came back with not psoriasis and could not rule out Ozempic.   After 72 years of no allergies, I now have an allergy to semiglutide.

I thought once my breakout cleared up after medicating topically for more than 3 months, I actually have a worse reaction to Ozempic.  My Thyroid started failing.  Their list of side effects said Thyroid tumors or cancer.  They didn't say anything about Thyroid slowing down.  I now have to take medication to try and fix my Thyroid. 

What did Ozempic do for me?  It slightly lowered my blood sugar. It gave me an allergy to semiglutide.   Affected my Thyroid Stimulating Hormone and put it higher than it should be which now caused me severe weight loss; muscle loss; fatigue; extreme difficulty climbing stairs.  No strength at all.  Also, the Thyroid issue causes problems with swallowing.  Not just food, but water as well.

This was the worst experience I ever had with a drug.  It looks like I'm going to being paying for it for as long as I live."

Been on all the pills and only insulin for the past 6 years.  Up to 80 units/day of Levemir.  Look, the first 3 months on Ozempic is rough.  I've read ALL the reviews and yes, the nausea, bloating, belching, are there but once your body gets used to the drug you WILL be good to go.  This stuff changes the way food passes thru your system and emulates the GLP1 hormone and that's a phenomenal thing!   I am the leanest I've been in 25 years.  Lost 25 lbs which was every bit of my excess fat, the medicine has taken away my urge to eat all the time and when I do I feel full very quickly!  A great thing!

The stomach ache and vomiting is unusual but I didn't link it to the meds because again I hadn't read any reviews or any info at all really,  but by the 4th day after dose increase (today) severe cramping in my stomach and vomiting almost immediately after eating,  burps that smell and taste rotten  i decided to look for some answers,  im not sure about weight loss yet but I haven't even tried to eat again,  im actually scared to so yeah im sure weight-loss would follow so I guess the question is weather or not I can handle this and of course how long it lasts , I know if I can lose weight and keep it off I would like to be able to hang in there but I guess time will tell, I will try to remember to update my progress on here and hopefully help someone with my story but in the end its up to the individual and what weight-loss is to them as in any diet witch is why some work well for certain people and yet not at all for others Good luck to all of u and God  bless"

As of April 13, 2022, I’m down to 298lbs.I’m so excited for the future as my doctor has been amazed and excited by my results. A low carb diet really is the difference paired with working out consistently. A good resource is to use the Carb Managerapp, it helps to see to gauge how many carbs/fat/sugars you are intaking on a daily basis. The results take time, but keep going and stay encouraged!"

Using this along with trying to eat right and walk.  I am not hungry and get full quicker. My doctor actually started me on Wellbutrun and Naltrexone for about a month or so then added Ozempic 0.25.  It does cause bad constipation so I take a stool softener EVERY DAY.  I need to lose 25 more lbs and I will be at my goal.

It is easy to read, I just move the dial to 0.25 mg. I am to take 0.25 for 1 month, 0.5 for a month and then move to the 1mg dose pen. Because I read hundreds of reviews first, I took it in the leg. I have had minimal side effects, if any. I started over 300 pounds and I am down about 7 pounds. Before taking this I had severe swelling in my legs for over a year that limited how I could move. The swelling in my legs has been gone now for about a week, and I feel so much stronger. I was able to stand on my feet so much easier for activities. I eat smaller portions because I feel fuller. I will keep in touch as I know more or after changing the dose. I am a little bit fatigued, but I was much more fatigued before I started to take it."

The steroids made me insulin resistant. I was on weight gaining medicine prescribed by a couple of my specialist for my other conditions that were helping me walk again and I didn't realize it. So my doc put me on Metformin and Ozempic for three and a half weeks. So my internist doc put me on Metformin for two weeks then added Ozempic.  Had to come off allinsulin.  it was in three days of taking this Metformin I lost 3 lb. My doctor recommends .25mg  for the first 4 weeks and then I'll go up .5 mg for another 4 weeks then if needed the 1 mg. Which I think has helped with the manageable symptoms. She has found the combo helps to not need to go to high on the Ozempic. I think the slow dosing is the way to go for me. I am probe to whatever severe side effects are in meds.  But I've only had some nausea bloating, headache, constipation but all mild and tolerable. I take daily probiotics and eat a diet full of  foods that help with digestion like kimchi, cabbage, onions or yogurt etc. I also recommend magnesium supplement on occasion. I also significantly increase my water and got one of those 2.2 L bottles. I realize when I don't drink enough water the constipation occurs.  I have been eating paleo since 2011. So while while trying to lose weight, I've been keep my carbs moderately low like around 70 g and my proteins between 80 and 100; high in good fats. 5'11 and started at 340. I have noticed when I eat I really rich dish and I really have upset stomach afterwards. I had a decrease appetite and full wicked fast immediately after taking Ozempic. I get all my carbs from fruits, nuts and vegetables. If I eats sweets it's not with cane sugar  but paleo and keto kind when I have a craving. I can't tolerate most of the sugar substitutes so I use coconut sugar but don't really have a sweet tooth now. Gluten gives me inflammation. So when I do make a sweet it's usually with a nut flour/butter. So in three weeks I am down to 328 at my last weigh-in. Again I think so and study those wins the race. Changing my diet. Getting my body moving in some way. for me it was just minimal walking. 

I have been successful in loosing weight in the past but nothing was working. This Ozempic and metformin has been amazing for me after almost 1 year in trying to lose weight on my own."

I started Ozempic on 3/31/22 at the 0.25 dose. I had little to no side effects from my first dose. I felt a little tired and maybe a little bloated but nothing major. I did notice right away I wasn’t hungry or craving sweets like before. I was full much faster and that feeling really surprised me as before i felt like I could eat eat forever and never be satisfied. I really like the feeling of being full and not constantly thinking about food. In my first week I have lost down to 226. I just took my 2nd  0.25 dose today 4/6/22 and so far no side effects just hopefull for more weight loss. My A1C is 6.4 and sugar in morning runs 140s. I have seen a slight decrease in morning sugars they are now running in the 130s. I have my follow up in 3 months with my A1C. I am hoping this med is a god send for me.

Ive been put on 0.25mg for the time being, we found out i was insulin resistant so my doc wanted me to loose some weight.
Other than a little nausea and some constipation (nothing some raw probiotics can't fix) I feel fine. I do think starting on a lower dose has a huge impact on how severe your symptoms can get.
The scale fluctuates. I can't get a real reading on my weight loss. I'll be down 3 kgs 1 day, then up again in 2 days.
It's definitely helped with portion control. I get fuller much quicker now. Over all water retention has dropped I don't feel so 'puffy'. - my legs, ankles and feet were becoming so swollen for over 3 months - that's stopped now.
Over all I feel great to be honest. Let's hope there will be a little more weigh loss over the next few weeks...."

In short this drug has been AMAZING. All the negative reviews had me terrified. There were some side effects. The burping, bloating, and nausea are mainly linked to what I chose to eat (and how much of it). Only eat half of what you’re used to.  Even if you still feel hungry, stop eating. In about 5–10 minutes you’ll feel super full and if you keep going you’re going to feel so bloated and nauseous. I was an emotional eater, I craved things relentlessly. Now I hardly think about food. It gives you the chance to make good decisions because sweets and fast food just don’t sound good. I haven’t given up anything I want, I just don’t want it."

Despite all this I would highly recommend ozempic. I have pcos and have tried many 'diets' over the years and can honestly say this is the most effective thing I have tried. I did not change my diet (I followed the guidance by my supplier to continue eating as normal), the idea of this is to your train your brain to eat smaller portions of your usual meals, so I never ever felt deprived or that I was dieting - ozempic massively reduced my appetite so it has been so easy to adjust to eat smaller portions. The benefits of this has far outweighed the odd couple of days feeling a bit off."

The only changes I made were to my diet, no more take out (rarely ate it and when I did I paid the price). Did barely any physical activity to lose the weight.  

I have been struggling to loose the weight and this really gave me the kick start I needed to get on track. I’m now 25 pounds away from my goal weight. 

Pros: weight loss and feeling so much better about myself 

Cons: don’t over eat or you’ll pay. Crazy stomach pain, gross burps, vomiting. It was crazy. 


Yes, some times it was really bad. But the goal is to loose the weight and get off it and maintain. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is obese and their weight is a concern to their health. But you must change your diet to be clean and not over eat or else you will have the worst experience. Eat salads!"

I’ve done 0.25mg for 2 weeks, then 0.5mg for 2 weeks. So far I’ve lost about 2kg, but I didn’t expect to lose much while I was weaning on. 

I’ve had pretty minimal side effects, just a little nausea & slugishness, kind of like an early pregnancy feeling. But it’s eased as times gone by. 

I inject into my thigh which a lot of people say reduce side effects. 

It’s interesting because I have always struggled with eating, very much an all or nothing kind of eating disorder. But Ozempic has been able to help me regulate eating at a more appropriate balance. For example I can have a snack sized chocolate bar once a day and be satisfied, in the past if I was on sugar I’d eat a whole Block of chocolate and that’s all id want all day. 

I crave healthy foods too like fruit and veg. 

And even on the days where I haven’t had great eating I haven’t gained any weight.

The side effects have gone away and my energy has increased considerably.  I've lost 2.5 pounds per week since starting and my blood work has improved greatly.

Semaglutide,Ozempic,2/9/2022,Nicole,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,"I started this medication 6 months ago after I had gained about 50 lbs from medications I was on to treat my chronic pain. I was eating very healthy, exercising and doing everything I could but couldn’t lose a pound. My dr suggested Ozempic and I was pretty skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. I was 190 lbs. I started at the 0.25 dose for the first 2 weeks but let me tell you that the day I did my injections I thought I was going to literally die that night. I was up all night with diarrhea, vomiting and severe sweating and abdominal cramping from hell. I decided to stick it out and see if it would get better and it did. I was actually terrified when I had to increase to my 0.5 dose but surprisingly it was much better. Within the first 2 weeks I had dropped 13 lbs.I had no appetite really and found I had to remember to eat at times, I had zero cravings and normally I’m a chocoholic! I couldn’t believe it! I continued to drop weight and at times it would plateau for a few weeks and I’d be puzzled as to what was going on and then all of a sudden it would drop suddenly again. I’ve been on the 0.5 now for about 5 months and am down 38 lbs. I’ve just recently started experiencing some issues with low blood sugars, shakiness, excessive fatigue, sugar cravings and hunger again so after seeing my dr yesterday he’s suggested dropping back down to the 0.25 to see if it helps. I have found the pens very easy to use. My dr actually suggested I purchase the 2ml pens and taught me how to count the clicks(18 is 0.25 ml) and (36 is 0.50ml) and I just mark it with a sharpie. I have no coverage and this has helped with cost so just a little tip that’s helped me. Hope this is helpful information. I would highly recommend this medication"

I started at the .25 dose and over a few months went up to 1 mg dose. At first there were no side effects but lost about a pound a week. After starting the .50 dose I began having major constipation which increased as the doses were increased. I tried many products and tips to ease the constipation but, unfortunately, it began to affect my mental health and decided to go off of the ozempic. My hunger was ravenous when I came off of itand I sadly gained most of my weight back. After a few months I decided to give it another try after my weight loss/diabetic Dr. contacted me with an idea of a drug to help with the constipation. I found it difficult to take because it was an hour before each meal and my work schedule made it very difficult to do so. I am now trying lactulose to try and help. So far, so good. I have lost a few of the pounds I gained back and my hunger is decreased significantly. I do like this product for its positive side effects of weight loss and lowering my A1c levels. I am crossing my fingers that I can stay on it with minimal side effects, as I was able to go off of Metformin and lose significant weight."

Semaglutide,Ozempic,1/12/2022,Vivian,55-64,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,"My Dr suggested Ozempic about 7 months ago, for obesity.  I had tried everything to lose weight.  I had gained a lot off additional weight during the first few covid lock downs.  My weight 10 months ago was 270 pounds.  I lost the first 30 pounds on my own and then in July, at 240 pounds, started with ozempic.  I've lost at a steady rate of close to 1 pound per week.  I'm now down to 196 pounds.  

I started with .25 and gradually increased dosage.  Amazingly, I almost immediately felt full after a few bites during a meal.  I had never experienced that feeling before.  In the past I could eat endlessly, and not realize it until much later that I was too full.  
I do burp, occasionally constipated  and experience some fatigue.  I also experienced heart burn. I've now become aware that my fatigue is related to my sugar levels dropping to low.  And the rest of the symptoms can be managed by eating less at one sitting.  

With ozempic, the food in my stomach is very slow to digest.  Hence the burping and heart burn.  It stays in your stomach much longer,  helping you feel full longer.  
My Dr warned me that rich, or oily foods could cause upset stomach and diarrhea.   So I was very careful initially with what I ate.  Now, my meals are do small, a few bites of something rich doesn't impact me.  Surprisingly though, I have very little interest in the desserts and snacks that I did in the past.  

I'm so pleased with how this has worked for me!"

After trying a calorie restricted diet of under 1200 cals for many years that had stopped working despite strict adherence, and daily exercise for 3 hours/8-9 kms walking for nearly a year now that did not result in significant weight loss. 
The first week was rough, in bed with migraine, nausea, heartburn and fatigue the third day. Constant nausea.  The second week I reduced the dose from 20 pen clicks to 17 (less than the starting dose of0.25) and that reduced the side effects. At 6 weeks on the reduced dose, I still have a lot of burping, mild crampy abdominal pain, heartburn at times managed by Tums, and low grade nausea.
However, my previously constant ravenous hunger that distracted me so much I was actually misdiagnosed with ADHD at one point, is now a more normal hunger at mealtimes. I have not changed my low calorie diet and am still exercising 3+ hours daily. But after a year of no weight loss on that strict regimen, adding Ozempic even at this low dose, has resulted in a steady 1 lb per week loss or more. After 6 weeks, I am down almost 10 lbs and no longer in the obese category. But the miracle is that I am not tortured by hunger 24/7 anymore. My hunger used to wake me up at night, now I can sleep through and wait for a light breakfast. I am going to try going back to the 0.25 dose this week and hope the severe side effects do not return. I wrote this so others who may be more sensitive to the side effects can know that you do not have to start at 0.25 but the pen can deliver a smaller dose with fewer clicks and it still works."

Some sleep issues and gas but nothing unbearable.  After 18lbs loss in 3 months and 2 progressions from 0.25 to 0.75 I started to experience a really negative side effect:  major hair loss.  I have a big mane and it was coming out from the root in clumps.   I went to see my dermatologist thinking it must be something to do with stress or some allergy and he asked me what I had started doing two to three months ago.   I told him I had started ozempic and he looked it up.  There they were - reviews of others who had experienced severe hair loss.  Nowhere on the box or on ozempic’s site was it mentioned.  So fat and hairy or slim and bald?   That was Sophie’s choice.  I had started to flatline and was feeling strangely “low” in mood  anyway so decided to come off it and try the old fashioned boring way, again.   My weight doctor wants to explore other options but I am inclined to forget the miracle aids for now.  I should mention that my dermatologist did say there was a chance that the body would adjust and the hair loss would cease.   Then again, there was a chance it would continue.   Just want to share this as it was a real concern."

Before starting the medication, I read some reviews that injecting into thighs instead of abdomen prevent side effects, and it was true. I have lost nearly 20 lb with following a health diet and reducing calorie. My fasting blood sugar, which was around 7.5 has dropped significantly, often in the normal range. I anticipate my A1C is dropped to normal range based on my random reading. I feel great and energetic even though that I have reduced my eating. So give this a try but only inject into thighs and it works. I hope Ozempic would be covered with my insurance, but it is not. This is a game changer med, but I hope those side effects seen in animal studies (pancreas and thyroid conditions) would not be developed with long-term use."

I started on the .25 mg two weeks ago, my morning blood sugar was around 150-160 when Iwas taking 1000mg ER of metformin, now they are down to 120-130.  I'm thinking they will go down more once I go up to the .5 mg.  I have lost a little weight, but weight wasn't an issue for me to begin with.  I love only having to take one shot a week (which I don't hardly feel at all) as opposed to two big horse pills that I was taking of the Metformin.  I'm not craving sugar anymore either.

I was 315lbs, now I am 303.  I find my appetite is not like it used to be.  no cravings, when I eat, after I eat 1/2 my usual portion, I am full.   Digestion is slower. I took a couple wks for the medicine to kick in to get my brain on board with the size of my portions and the first week I ate too much and it gave me the runs, and one day that I totally pigged out on mcdonalds and pizza i had both runs and nausea.  Have not had a recurrence since.  I am not hungry, I eat what I want, although, when I eat too much sugar, my glucose spikes...duh.  It doesn't stop you from making stupid decisions if you make them with smaller portions.   Overall i like how it is helping me with my weight and that can only have a positive affect on my a1c and blood pressure.   I have had to use prune juice a couple times but i am getting used to only 1x/day BM instead of my normal 2 when I ate too much.   I have no other side affects, I feel great, I have more energy and am hopeful that I can lose weight without even trying.  It feels like a miracle.  I have been in the 300's since 2012.  I have tried weight watchers and others but I always felt hungry and so sabotaged my diet or program.  I am so excited to be in the 200's soon.  I have a needle phobia so at first I delayed taking because I was afraid of sticking myself.  I put mine in the flab that is under my arm.  alternating one arm one week and the other the next. just put my arm on table with flab rolled forward and stick it press, hold and done. I don't feel it at all.  i picked arm cuz reviews showed those who use in belly have more GI issues.  could be imaginary, but i figured its easier in my arm anyway and I can do anywhere. I then shake my arm, pat the fat and do some air punches to get it not to stay in one area cuz I fear it will hurt if it doesnt dissapate...thats my own hypothesis.   Anyway.... good luck.  I will report back on my A1c.  btw, I am a 59 yr old woman, actve, no unmanaged health prob except diabetes and weight.  I am not sedentary, I  have tried to walk at least a 1/2 mile 5x/wk but goal up to 5mi a day like I used to.  Knees bug me with all the weight, but getting easier."

It was the final solution to a never ending problem with my blood sugar. I was already taking Metformin, Gliclazide and Invokana, but no matter how I tried to eat better, exercised, nothing was happening. My blood sugar was still rising. At one point my blood sugar went up to 11 and it has never been that high before. So my G.P. referred me to an Endocrinologist. The first thing he did was order a blood test and review all my medications. Finally, because I was taking the maximum dosage on all the other meds, he asked me to try Ozempic. At first I was hesitant because he explained that I had to inject myself once a week (and I hate needles), but that this was not insulin. He said try this medication or I’ll start you on insulin. I would rather try other medication before submitting to a life of insulin everyday.    He was very candid about the side effects of this medication, 3 to 6 weeks of uncomfortable side effects, but it will all go away eventually. He said if the side effects doesn’t go away after 6 weeks, to give him a call and he can change it to something else.  Well, I persevered, but I will be brutally honest to whoever will be reading this review, you will be miserable and sick and wished to God it would end. I had nausea, vomitting, headaches, lightheadedness, diarrhea, and so many other physical discomfort that I kept telling myself it will be all worth it. I was ILL, so ill that at one point I couldn’t get out of bed. So if you are willing to risk taking this drug, then make sure to take a leave of absence from your workplace because you will end up calling in sick A LOT! I was fortunate enough to be off work, so all the horrible side effects didn’t affect my job.     Ozempic is my saving grace. The journey was not easy, but my results are shown on my blood test and urine test. To date my A1C is 5.2 and I’ve lost 39 lbs.My diet went from CRAP to healthy."

Semaglutide,Ozempic,9/25/2019,Cornish Dowser,55-64,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5.0,5,5,5,24.0,2,"Having read many threads on this forum I havn`t read any from users who also suffer with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) so I thought it might be helpful to share my experience as I have had IBS since my late teens. I am 64 now. I started as most people do with a weekly injection of .25 mg to start my body to get used to Ozempic. I thought at first that I had no side effects. This was not quite correct though as I believed I was experiencing low level IBS which was not unusual for me. However I began to notice this was happening more often than usual. What actually seemed to be happening was that I was not having a direct side effect, but the Ozempic was actually triggering IBS events. This became much more obvious when I moved on to the next dosage level of 0.5 mg. The effects began between 24 and 48 hours and these were high level (severe) IBS events which lasted for 3 - 4 days when I got very severe stomach cramps constant diarrhea with fecal incontinence when sleeping requiring making a nappy out of a bath towel for at least 2 nights. On the 3rd week of the 3rd month the effect happened only hours after the injection. when I started the 4th month I had no IBS reaction, other than a few sulphur burps and this is how it has remained. It was a very unpleasant 3 months but I pushed on because of the promised benefits. Four months on and no unpleasant side effects. The results seem to be very good and I am really pleased that I stayed with it, I was getting near to the point of wondering if all effects were going to be worth it. So my advice if you also have IBS is stay with it as long as you can, for me it was hugely successful in the end, even though it was a very unpleasant road getting there."

Not much difference, in fact I have decided to stop taking Ozempic because of the severe diarrhea and nausea.

i have no cravings or barely any appetite

I definitely recommend trying this 
I know some people have had bad side effects from this but at least try it it is definitely worth it

As a result of my weight yo-yo-ing and progressively going up my blood sugar #s are going up too. Diets (under 1500 calories) and daily exercise did nothing. My Dr. put me on Mounjaro 3 and a half months ago. 2.5, 5, 7.5and now I am starting 10. At 2.5 to 7.5 I was HANGRY 24/7. The ""food noise"" people talk about was off the charts. I felt like I was dehydrated all the time - no amount of water would stop that feeling. The BP medication gave me colitis symptoms - Mounjaro fixed that. I do feel better slightly taking Mounjaro than not taking Mounjaro. No abdominal pain, no back pain, no neck/thyroid issues, no allergy symptoms. Let's hope that 10 will yield different results.

All bad reviews are being not allowed on sites such as drugs.com as they are paid big money by certain companies. If you inject this drug you will lose your appetite yes. Along with that though you won’t enjoy anything anymore, a coffee, a tea you will vomit . For me, the second day I became dangerously sick, taken by ambulance. Treated for dehydration. 10 days later I’m still not Ok. I feel extremely weak & I’ve stop vomiting finally but still feel sick every waking minute."

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,11/24/2024,Lily,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,"I’ve been taking Mounjaro for six weeks (choosing to stay on 2.5mg for month two) and so far I’ve lost 14lbs of the 21lbs I need to lose. I’ve had no side effects at all, apart from a little nausea one time when I had a largish meal to be polite, and in fact I feel better than I have done in years. I have symptomatic hypertension and all that discomfort has gone. 
I do worry about the potential serious risks of taking such a new drug, but right now I’m weighing that against the known serious risks of being overweight and eating too many sugary foods. I’ve gone from having a sweet tooth to almost no interest in biscuits and chocolate or any kind of snacking between meals. I feel liberated from something I didn’t even appreciate was so much on my mind each day, but I think I have been lucky in my response to the drug as I know this low dose doesn’t suppress appetite for some people so effectively or causes unpleasant side-effects. 
I hope when I reach my target weight I’ll have had a reset on my habits but that may be optimistic, so that’s possibly when the hard yards begin."

I wish I had some suggestions on what to do with it. I also get the sulfur burps just prior to the diarrhea. I’ve started taking a little bit of Pepto-Bismol and that seems to have helped a bit. Third dose coming up. One thing that I found though on the second dose, I had the first day diarrhea. It went away for almost 4 days and then came back. I don’t know if this is common or not. Gonna try and stick it out but it’sbeen a little bit miserable, the first two weeks."

I have experienced nauseousness primarily the first two days after each injection with burping at a greater level daily. I have, through my doctor's advice, been following a diabetic diet and walking daily with upper body weight - lifting three times weekly. The appetite suppression is significant from day two after injection through day four or five with suppression easing the balance of the week, however, a small amount of food makes me full when the suppression eases. I started at a weight of 286 pounds and am now down to 243 pounds for a total of 43 pound weight loss in a little more than 9 1/2 weeks. The weight loss has been a little quicker than I would have anticipated, however, the diet and exercise recommended by Lilly and my doctor has made the weight loss more effective, in my opinion. I eat only what my body allows and am careful not to over eat and avoid high fat / high carb foods altogether. The only other side effect experienced is slow bowl movements which likely is a result of the lower amount of food intake. My doctor plans to hold me at 7.5 mg for the foreseeable future as he monitors the weight loss and effects on my A1C levels (I was only diagnosed as a diabetic prior to beginning mounjaro). My suggestion to anyone considering this treatment is to listen to what your body is telling you concerning tolerance of the medication and what / what not to eat along with amounts. Don't focus solely on the weight loss as everyone must remember it was originally developed for diabetes management with weight loss as a beneficial side effect."

I look miles better as at 5”10 I was 17st. Easy to use but there are a few side effect I have had. The main things are tiredness and aching legs and butt. It really does stop you gorging on foods and you eat small portions but most foods you lose the love for and are not really bothered about eating but you know you have to for energy. For me it has been a hard slog but the results far outweighs the side effects. You will eat better and when you see the results you will start to change your food habits. I have eaten more fruit in 5 months than I have in 5 years and really enjoy a plate of mixed fruits rather than chocolate and crisps.

Doctor started me on 10mg of Mounjaro and holy cow what a difference!! I not only am not hungry in general but have lost the cravings to snack. No side effects yet that I can see. I am too early into it to see the any weight loss benefits but am hopeful. I am only about 40lbs overweight but would like it to go. Very encouraged by my progress so far!
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,10/7/2024,DXBMum,45-54,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,4.0,4,5,3,1.0,0,"I began using Mounjaro to help shed the 3 extra kilograms I gained over the holidays. I'm not overweight or diabetic (I’m 165 cm tall and started at 59 kg), but I struggled to lose the weight this time. With menopause affecting my hormones, it became harder to drop those extra kilos, even though I lead an active lifestyle, working out 3-4 times a week and staying generally active.

After doing some research, I felt Mounjaro would be the right fit for me. I started with a 0.25 mg injection when Iweighed 58.7 kg.

As for the injection, it was simple to administer and completely painless. 

After the first dose, it took about two days to feel any effects. I experienced some mild diarrhea but otherwise felt fine—no nausea or major side effects. I began losing weight on day 3, and by the end of the first week, my appetite had decreased significantly. I was eating about half of what I normally would, and my weight dropped to 57.6 kg.

During the second week, I noticed my muscle mass decreasing (I track it with my EufyLife Scale), and I constantly felt thirsty. I also had a strange taste in my mouth, like I was detoxing. The diarrhea persisted, but there was no constipation. Unfortunately, my sleep quality began to suffer, as I would wake up around 3 a.m. and struggle to fall back asleep. By the end of week 2, I weighed 55.7 kg.

After my third injection, I began experiencing low blood pressure, constant fatigue, and weakness. My appetite vanished completely, and I had to force myself to eat, which was a bit alarming. My sleep continued to be disrupted, waking at 3 a.m. and struggling with insomnia, which likely contributed to my low energy levels. I also began experiencing brain fog, finding it hard to focus during conversations and struggling to concentrate at work. This has affected my productivity and overall quality of life, leaving me considering whether to discontinue the treatment.

By the end of week 3, I reached 54.5 kg, which was my goal. However, the impact on my overall well-being makes me think that the side effects are not worth continuing."

After nearly 6 months on the higher dose of Mounjaro my arthritis inflammation became more pronounced and I felt highly levels of joint pain. Also I felt less energy and interest in doing many daily tasks. Trying to identify the cause of these issues I decided to stop taking Mounjaro and within two weeks my arthritis pain was much lower andI didn’t need to take any NSAIDs for relief. Also, I also discovered that I no longer have ED, something I’ve had since first starting Mounjaro nearly two years ago.

This one review inspired me to give it a go.  I was extremely sceptical, but having tried other weight loss methods i decided to go ahead.  Amazingly, in 1 month i also lost 18lbs.  Hunger disappears almost immediately, and should you eat anyway there is a feeling of discomfort.  I can't say that there are no side effects, stool became infrequent and sleep may have not been as before, although whether that is caused by it i can't confirm.  However these are not serious side effects and in my opinion these are well worth enduring.  I'm now on a higher dose and am extremely happy with both the results and the effects.  
The downside is the relatively high price.  I am also aggrieved by the amount of wastage within the injection module, there is at least one weeks dose wasted from each months supply."

Reduced HbA1c through diet and weight loss but felt overly constrained by restricted diet.

HbA1c back to within normal range and all high BG symptoms e.g. feet tingling have gone.  Lost 11Kg (110 - 99) in 12 weeks but seem to have plateaued now.  Only bad symptoms occurred when on holiday I ate full english breakfasts - something I otherwise never do.  So I worked out that full portions of fatty foods are a no go. I've stayed on 5mg.

I went from a size 14-16 to a size 8.  The only side affects I have is itching at the site for a day after I take the shot.  I also have mild constipation from time to time, but the benefits outweigh these side affects.  I had nausea when I first started but that went away within the first month.  I eat small portions of something every 3 to 4 hours and I don't overeat because that is what makes you feel sick - like you've eaten a Thanksgiving meal.  I have a problem with the shortage that is occurring with this medication!  It's frustrating and stressful to call around trying to make sure I have this medication to treat my Type II Diabetes.  Manufactureres need to start making double what they produce."

I’ve been using a glucose monitor to keep on and eye on what’s happening. 
I’ve just taken my 4th dose of 2.5ml today and so far I have been very lucky with side effects, pretty much just headaches on and off and I would say my near vision has been more blurry - but I also wear glasses and have started to get a reading prescription, so could be a coincidence.

I’m trying to drink 2-3 pints of water a day alongside usual tea and coffee consumption and haven’t yet had any problems with loose or hard stools.

My glucose is amazing! I’m so shocked and delighted in equal measures and I’ve lost 5lb as of this morning (20 days) - which is actually great for me, I’m happy with 1.5-2lb a week loss, feels realistic. 

Will update again in a few weeks. 
I’ve decided to stick with 2.5ml for my next 4 doses as my body seems to be doing well."

I began taking this medication in the first week of April 2024 at the 2.5mg dose. After 4 weeks I had lost 14.5lbs (a stone!). This week I increased to the 5mg dose and have lost a further 3.3lbs. I am averaging a healthy weight loss of 1.5kg per week. I have had absolutely no adverse side effects whatsoever so far.  My appetite is significantly reduced and like other reviewers I havelost all cravings for sugar or sweets. I get full and stay full for much longer from smaller portions. As my appetite is reduced I am finding it a struggle to consume more than 1100 calories a day so I have ensured that I am eating healthy balanced meals to ensure I get decent nutrition / vitamins etc but other than this I have made no other lifestyle changes. I would recommend this medication to anyone who has struggled with binge eating, snacking, or cravings. The changes in my eating habits happened overnight and I have maintained the same energy levels despite drastically reducing my calorie intake thanks to Mounjaro.  I believe the 5mg dose is enough for me so intend to stay on this plan and not increase unless I begin to see my weight loss plateau before my goal weight is reached."

I was quite literally in the best shape of my life at 46 years old. Then like a flash, Covid hits and we go into lock down. If I am not active, I get really bad about eating. I mean really bad. Entire ice cream cakes multiple times a week, chips, cookies, candy.....you get the gist. Mostly it's from boredom but it quickly turns into an addictive habit to mask my own personal struggles. (never fully recovered 9/11 survivor and recovering Alcoholic.) I don't drink (haven't in nearly 20 years), don't smoke and somehow, in 1 year, my weight climbed to 195 lbs. How did I eat myself to that weight? Especially since I am only 5'6"". What a nightmare I got myself into....again. I somehow let this crazy eating cycle continue until I reached an absolute breaking point. Bottom if you may. I made a decision to commit to a new me, a healthy me and one that will be around for my daughter for a long time. I started Mounjaro 3 weeks ago when I weighed in at 194 lbs in my doctor's office, switched to a fully plant based diet, cut out ALL sugar, eliminated processed foods and I am exercising religiously. My weight as of the typing of this review is 176 lbs. My goal is to get back to the 145-150 range and hopefully ween off of the medication if I can. Fingers crossed. For anyone who is reading this that is struggling, I hope you hear my message as one of support because I know how easy it is to mask life's issues with food.  I have spent my entire life losing weight, gaining it back and adding a little extra. I just got sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. I know my weight loss is not a ton, but at the end of the day, we are all looking to accomplish the same thing. Know that you are worth the effort to me, friends, family, neighbors, kids, etc. You can lose the weight and be a new you.  Just stay committed to making a mindset shift and don't view this as a ""diet"". View this as a positive lifestyle change that will keep you planted on the earth for a long time and not planted in it before it's your time. I could not be happier and I know you will as well. Just be patient and let the universe drive during this journey."

Once I stay at goal weight for 3+ months, I plan to have a breast reduction and lift (no implants) to complement my healthier body. My body has experienced less inflammation as arthritis, headaches and fibromyalgia are improved by better food choices and higher activity resulting in weight loss.

Now, I did start eating healthy and exercising at the same time; but I truly believe I could not have done this w/o the Mounjaro. In the past, my biggest problem was that I was a binge-eater: eating whatever I was craving for in very large quantities. But the immediate effects I noticed with this AMAZING MED is that it took all my cravings away; and I actually don't really think about food at all. I hardly ever need to eat more than 1,500 calories per day. The only side-effect that I did notice was that I was generally tired in the 1st week after taking it; but my body has adjusted and I'm good now. For the first time in over 17 yrs, I truly believe that Mounjaro will help me get to my goal weight of 178.

I am puking like it's my job and my boss isn't happy about that.  I took it for about a month in Nov/Dec 23 and the doctor told me to stop for awhile and try again just to confirm that it actually is this medication that's making me so sick.  I just started last Sun with another shot and I have been sick as a dog all week.  I might lose weight because I can't keep food down but that is not a diet plan that I can livewith.  It made the holidays miserable!!

The first week I lost 6 lb in the second week I lost nothing and started getting significantly increased appetite. Is this normal? I'm getting very disappointed trying to lose weight after menopause and it's depressing. I'm afraid to go up to five milligrams because I've heard horror stories about the side effects so I probably will not do that. They have not studied this drug long enough
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,2/2/2024,HOU,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5.0,5,5,5,,1,"Started on 2.5 in August because I was looking for one medication to lower A1C. Currently on Metformin and Jardiance. By November, A1C dropped from 6.9 to 5.8. Changing diet also helped lower cholesterol. I titrated up to 5 mg, but since then I've gone back to 2.5 due to not wanting to lose any more weight. I lost a total of 30 pounds and have been maintaining my weight for the past 30 days, which I'm comfortable with. I worked out 3-5 days a week during this time and did intermittent fasting. Even with working out, I noticed muscle and strength loss, so I'm now doing more strength training to build back up. Currently, 2.5 mg does not suppress my appetite, but it continues to help me with glucose levels. I wear a CGM. I hope to keep the weight off with the tools I've learned in the past six months. I experienced minimal side effects on both doses, occasionally slight headache and constipation. My goal is to eliminate all other medications and stay on this low dose as my only medication for diabetes."

I like the medicine since it’s helping me with my blood sugar but I hate it when I feel nauseous and have heartburn in the night, that makes me can’t sleep well.

I have PCOS and up until 9 years ago the only treatment I was given was low dose birth control... until I met my Dr for life. 
I've been eating Low Carb for 3 years and Nutritional Keto for 8 months now. (Virta) 
When I started I was 347lbs. I am 5'2.. I was spherical .  I dropped weight rapidly (around  170lbs) and then laziness got me back up 40lbs.  
My Dr started me on Mounjaro after tellingher about the "" food noise"" and the difficulty maintaining 20 or less carbs and my borderline Type 2 A1C for the last decade.
Mounjaro has helped immensely.  I've had digestion issues and injection site rashes due to my already super sensitive skin. Hydrocortisone cream and resisting the urge to scratch has helped.

I stalled out on 7.5mg & experienced the dreaded food noise, weight loss stall and hunger. After discussing what was going on with my Dr, she bumped me up to 10mg & I'm doing much better.  I just did my 3rd week injection this morning and that 40lb gain is gone.  
The weight loss has been slow and steady but more importantly I am eating healthier, feeling satisfied and I can now determine food noise from actual hunger. 
For those of you struggling I can't stress this enough ..talk to your Dr. ! They should be able to help & guide you where you need to be and if they don't...find someone who will. 

Good luck & great health!

I started 2.5 mg June 23, 2023 and have lost 65 lbs as of Nov. 6th.  I have had no side effects whatsoever thankfully and the appetite suppression has been a game changer for me.  I used to think about food constantly.  Iwould go to bed thinking about what to have for breakfast.  Now, my mind is calm regarding food.  I eat much smaller portions, get full faster and stay full longer.  I don't crave sweets like I used to and overall just try to eat better than I did before.  I'm not saying I'm eating lettuce and ice for meals, I still eat pretty much whatever sounds good but I find that I lean towards very small portions and more veggies and fruits.  I also take bariatric vitamins with mine just to make sure I'm getting the nutrients I need to keep any unwanted side effects at bay.  I will keep on my journey and hope this helps someone along the way.  I am at 10 mg now btw and intend to stay at this level as long as I continue to lose weight.

Every type of diet tried in the past with great results for each, but at 316 lbs this year, no longer had the discipline or physical ability to repeat any of those efforts.  Started on Mounjaro  paying my own way, on March 3rd of this year. 
43 weeks in, with no side effects of any type; I've lost 103 lbs.  Eating far less and healthy as I'm able, but no food regimen of any type. Same for exercise.  This is a miracle drug, with terrific results for blood pressure (now 118/68), A1c (5.7), PSA actually decreasing (.15) and walking up to 3 miles at a time vs 1 block in March.
Cost is the only prohibitive factor for folks.  Cancer, heart disease and diabetes don't cause obesity. The profession seems to have it backwards regarding treatment.  Hoping medicare realizes this sooner than later. Thanks again for your  help."

After finally being referred to a great endocrinologist I found out I was type 2 diabetic, with PCOS and autoimmune thyroiditis. My doctor recommended Mounjaro this past June 2023 after I was suffering from kidney problems as well. Let me say I cannot be more thankful for this medication. My blood sugar levels have be great and the weight has been dropping off me for the first time in 10 years. I peaked at about 301 lbs back in June (at 5’10) and as of today I am 255lbs. I cried when I felt like I was finally finding a solution to better my health. Besides some nausea and diarrhea with dose increases, I have found the injection to be tolerable and easy to use.

I have lost 100 pounds as of 10-9-23. I walk 3 miles a day at a fast pace finishing  in 45 mins. I eat a very low carb diet. If I eat too much I get that sick feeling and know not to eat anymore. I eat about 4-6 ounces of protein at lunch and dinner with 2 vegetables at each meal. Breakfast I drink a premier protein shake because it has the least amount of sugar. For a snack I eat nuts, or a TBL of peanut butter. No soda, yogurt, pasta, breads, limit fruit. As of 6-3-23 I was taken off of BP, cholesterol, asthma medication. My A1C went from 7.6 to 4.2. I use a dessert plate for my meals so it helps with portions control. I take my shot 7.5 on Thursday evening so that if it does cause me to be ill 2 days after it would be on the weekend when I am off work. I read that from another review that they did that. If you eat to much, wrong foods (sugar, carbs, raw veggies, pork, beef) you will get sick.

I've lost a total of 30lbs. Still feel good. More energy. Mood better. 
Only side effect I've had going up in dose is the first time I did the injection of 5 I felt super nauseous and ended up throwing up a lot. By third day I was fine again. Did second injection and same thing happened. However I noticed I didn't feel the best right after having dairy and popcorn. So the third week of 5 I avoided anything dairy or greasy. And no corn popcorn and did fine. After fourth injection felt fine too. Seems if I avoid anything hard on digestive system for a few days I'm fine. 
I’ve noticed I cannot tolerate red meat or ham very well. Also have to limit my dairy. No yellow cheese. White cheese can tolerate in small amounts. 
Despite on 2.5 dosage I could eat anything no problem. Just didn’t eat very much. 
So be mindful that if you ate fine on first dosage doesn’t mean you will be able to as you up the dosage. I keep a log of what I eat and how I feel afterwards so I can see what may be bothering me."

I use flax seed in my oatmeal or yogurt daily for excellent results.(1/3 of the suggested daily amount works for me)

I was increased to mounjaro 5 at that visit. Still no side effects. On 08/22/23 Lab collected 5 weeks later on mounjaro 5 in Sept, A1C now 5.6%. It is so wonderful to feel what ""normal"" must feel like. Minimal appetite,no side effects so far after 5 weeks. Weight loss. Hope it helps my cholesterol. Have to make myself eat. Making so much better food choices, healthy food when I do eat. No sugar cravings at all. My blood sugars were over 250 to start now 95-101 in the mornings. I want to go up to the 7.5 next primary care visit in November and stay on that dose through the upcoming holidays. Mounjaro is life altering and life changing! I've never felt so wonderful! I would like to get down to approximately 160 which is still a little bit to go. I weigh in and take my injection every Saturday. On 09/22/23 I weighed in at 237.8. That's 34.2 less pounds since 06/06 and starting Mounjaro! So still have 77.8 pounds to go. My next immediate goal is to be below 200 lbs by New Year's Eve.(Fingers crossed).

Nothing worked and I really didn't eat that much but the belly weight stayed. No matter how much I dieted or exercised. Since the good Lord helped, my Dr put me on mounjaro.  I have lost weight, walking at lrk and most importantly all my lab numbers have gone normal and have dropped from 40 to 100 pts. Even my liver numbers.  I still am having to be checked but so far they are n normal range still.  I have had one episode of abdominal pain but can't swear that was the mounjaro or diverticulitis when I first started. Now I eat basically one good meal a day  fruit or something light for  the other 2. I haven't been hungry or deprived of anything you just don't want it and you are able to do other activities that you haven't been able or felt like doing before , so u don't think about eating.i walk at least 2 hrs a day 3 days a week not strenuous just leisurely around stores treadmill or neighborhood. Or I swim.  I can do my house and yardwork now and I finally feel like I have had a break through. I don't like taking medication and I drag my feet with my Dr when she suggests a new one, but I am so thankful I listened to her about this drug it has made such a difference in my life and health.

Only issue I have had is first day I ate to fast as was in a hurry and ate to much and tummy felt like pressure of feeling over full. Only other time was I tried a fruit drink and the sugars going way up made me a bit nauseous. Those are the only things I’ve noticed. So I just make sure to eat slower and pay attention to feeling satisfied rather than full like diabetes counselor recommended. 
Next week I go up to 5 dosage.

My tidbit that has helped me so much is wearing a CGM because it’s helped give me a way better insight into what affects my sugars and how they are doing on a daily. Plus showing me mounjaro is helping."

Liver CT confirmed severe nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. I brought the idea of mounjaro to my doc because recent trials indicate great result for my health conditions. From the first dose, I had so much more energy - feel 20 years younger. I have more energy to exercise and my muscles recover from use much more quickly. I don't think my body has been processing energy correctly foryears. The ""food"" voice in my head is also quiet for the first time in 30 years. Downside is I don't feel like shopping or cooking for the family! Eating small meals, avoiding carbs and fats means no stomach upset. I used prilosec for the first month but once I adjusted, I stopped using it. I still take daily probiotics to encourage good gut health. Fruit, prunes, figs help everything keep moving even at 7.5mg dose.  My numbers are all down and liver function has improved in only 3 months. I look forward to seeing the numbers at 1 year. However, the primary benefit is that I feel great and can participate in my life so much more. This is a great drug and it is criminal that health insurance, including Medicare, does not cover it. I don't mind cost sharing  - eyeing a piece a cake and thinking whether it is worth $1000 is hefty motive to avoid it - but this drug has real health and quality of life benefits that insurance should help cover. Everyone in my family dies of cardiovascular disease of some kind - stroke, heart attack, heart failure. I am relieved to have a drug that can help fight against this future. The unexpected benefit is how great I feel while I am improving my health.  We all need to work hard with our state and federal regulators to make sure this drug and related ones are covered under both public and private health insurance plans."

Constipation is not great but manageable.  I find that 7.5mg does not work as well as the 5mg.  Any nausea can be managed by eating.  Only feels sick if I don't eat anything.

I have to say though that I am on this medication because of diabetes and the constant shortages have had an impact on me. For the folks that are looking for weight loss from an injection @ $1,000 a month maybe just clear out your pantry of chips and pop and get a membership to the gym.

It has been something very difficult to manage to say the least. My A1c have yo-yo'd from most recent was 11.4 and the lowest was an 8.9, a constant struggle. I am 5'1"" and last weigh in was 219 at my PCP, so I was prescribed Mounjaro 2.5mg and next day I was so nauseated I had to go buy Emetrol. I had to learn to adjust everything that I ate, portions, I come from a generation that you had to eat everything off your breakfast, lunch and dinner plates. I now do not do that at all, I eat until I sense being full, my portions are like for a toddler and I am ok with that. I do not crave bread, sweets, or fried. It has been 2 months now and I am down to 206, I feel excited to continue the health eating. I am not a picky eater at all but find myself wanting healthier foods, natural plant based foods and fat free protein. I don't question it but my mind guides me to healthy choices just for the organic flavor of the food. If I eat anything that I am not supposed to eat is when I get symptoms of nausea, and I use to be regular with BM but now find myself doing more stool softeners or prune juice once a week to stay regular. I have incorporated 30 minutes on a treadmill  or a brisk bike ride at least 3 times a week and 5lb weights workout in between. Do I recommend this?, well yes I do if it will help you get into a much healthier routine because it is very hard to get into one. I should add that I am a cardio patient with 3 stents, DM2 insulin dependent and breast and ovarian survivor and I am only 52. I still have more living to do in this lifetime."

Though I am losing slowly, I’m losing at a faster pace than my 11 years ago younger self lost on low carb. I have an appetite for food but just don’t want much of it.

Note I'm very sensitive to all meds. A little goes a long way. Must track calories and keep at 1200 if you have trouble losing weight anyway.  2 months on 2.5 only side effects relatively bad constipation until day before next shot. Taking a laxative every other day helps. You must drink a lot of water. Lost 4 lbs first week but for me weight loss has been slow with hungar returning 2 days before next shot and calories increase to 1500. But prior was not able to stay at 1200 calories no matter what I did due to hunger. 3rd month went up to 5.5 dose. Same side effect. 4th month same. Weight loss of about 2 lbs a week. Eating a 3rd to half less at meals. Food thoughts a lot less too. All bearable. 5th month went up to 10.5 dose. First shot just normal side effect. 2nd shot of 20.5 all hell broke loose. Took my dose Sunday evening.  Monday afternoon gastro side effects started. Tuesday terrible intestinal cramps, near constant diarrhea, horrible gas burps. Thank God I've got a bidet. Could not leave house. No amount of anti diarrhea meds or Zofran helped. Wednesday about the same. But well enough loaded up on anti diarrhea med to go to a standalone IV drip place because its cheaper than urgent care. I knew as was dehydrated.  Felt better but still not normal stomach wise. Today, Thursday still sick with cramps , nausea cannot leave the house. Going down to 7.5 and skip a few days before injecting again. Dr. appointment on Monday for yearly physical."

The things I have been so impressed with is that I do not stress eat, I am choosing healthy meals and I am not hungry. I have noticed that eating healthy food helps me avoid the sometimes nausea I experience. I do have to pay 995 dollars a monthwhich is more than my social security check. But I am choosing to be healthy. I am grateful for this game changing medication. I lost a child to suicide 14 years ago and gained weight that I have not been able to loose.

My appetite has definitely decreased, but I make myself eat with my priority of meeting a protein goal of 1 gram per pound of body weight to preserve muscle mass.  I had lost 15 pounds prior to starting Mounjaro and that took roughly a year to do that, so I'll continue to lose slowly.  My blood sugar is averaging 80s to 90s now.

I experienced no negative side effects and was increased to the 5mg dosage beginning the fifth week. Again, no negative side effects from the increased dose. I had already began eating better and walking at the time of diagnosis, so it’s hard for me to say how much of an effect Mounjaro has had on my appetite and weight loss, but today, July 4, 2023, my A1C is 5.1 and I am down 80lbs.

The first month very little side effects and decent appetite suppression. Week 5 and 6 I’m getting bouts of 1 to 2 hours of nausea and heartburn. Just suffered through one. They happen maybe once a day early afternoons or evening. Todays was the worst and now I feel fantastic. The symptoms come in like an incoming tide and abruptly leave. 

I’m encouraged by some of the similar reviews where the side effects eventually subsided after 2 or 3 months. Hopefully mine will too. I notice I have to force myself to eat 200-400 calories 4 or 5 times a day. I don’t want to lose too much muscle. Kicking in bicycling this week. 

Almost a miracle drug for my health. I’ve lost 10 pounds, my BP is normal and my sugar levels in range. Along with food it’s really important to drink water constantly. I drink a gallon a day. 

Mounjaro is doing what I couldn’t do alone. It’s a great tool if can tolerate. I want to thank everyone who has shared. I hope my post helps others."

I am a senior citizen and use medicare (as I have earned that right) and do not qualify for any kind of savings coupon or program from Eli Lilly.  What did the senior citizens of this country ever do to Eli Lilly that we don't qualify to save any money when buying this drug?
My doctor told me I might soon become pre-diabetic if I do not lose weight. I have tried numerous ways to lose weight and so far Mounjaro is the only thing that has helped.  Many seniors are in the same situation and could use something as effective a Mounjaro, but apparently Eli Lilly has it in for us.
Not surprising is that Eli Lilly was ordered to pay $61 million for skimping out on Medicaid rebates and vowed to fight the verdict. But instead of the result Lilly wanted, the award has been tripled to more than $183 million.

An Illinois federal judge (Harry Leinenweber) ruled that Eli Lilly owes triple damages from last year's award after whistleblower Ronald Streck convinced a jury that the company violated the False Claims Act and short-changed Medicaid on rebate payments.

Since the case falls under the False Claims Act, the award was eligible for ""trebled"" damages, according to court filings.

The case dates to 2014, when whistleblower Streck—a pharmacist and lawyer—sued Eli Lilly for allegedly launching retroactive price increases and failing to pay Medicaid rebates based on the higher prices.

Way to go Eli Lilly ... keep up the good work of making Americans pay through the nose for medications that can help improve quality of life."

After dieting my whole life I know that the last few pounds are the hardest to lose, but with Mounjaro I feel that I can lose down to my goal and maybe a little more. My average glucose is 115 over my 5 weeks with Mounjaro so I know my next A1C will be way less.  I wish I could add a few more carbs, but that may be wishful thinking.  I am not ready to move to next dose and I plan to stay on  a 2.5 for a while."

My doctor suggested Mounjaro.  I am starting week 3 and wanted to share my experience.  First of all, it changed my life so drastically that I could hardly believe it.  As others have stated, it changed my RELATIONSHIP with food.  Here are some of the changes:  I no longer focus on food or have cravings for salty and sweet, carb foods, it just seemed to vanish beginning day #3.  I no longer have the urge for late night snacking.  I really can’t eat carbs like potatoes, breads, etc. or I get a stomach ache, bad enough where I really don’t want to bring that on again by eating that food.  Big one – I was so fatigued before, I could barely make it through my workday and many times would go straight to bed.  I’m now up until bedtime and have energy, to the point that I started going into the pool and doing some gentle exercising.  Another biggie – I eat a big breakfast, usually eggs/cheese and bacon/sausage and that pretty much lasts me most of the day.  I almost have to look at the clock to see if I need to eat dinner because I just don’t get that hungry.  Oh, another biggie – I was drinking root beer, I was able to drop that completely and transition to water.  I put orange or lemon essential oil in it and am happy with sipping on that all day.  I’ve cleaned the house out of the carb stuff and given it to a family with foster children.  I don’t know what is in this medicine, but it really has made a profound impact on my life.  I’ve lost 6 pounds so far, but it feels like I’ve lost a couple inches in my clothes.  Highly Recommend!"

I took my very first Mounjaro 2.5mg shot this morning right after breakfast.at 9:30am. Within an hour I felt weak and lethargic. My legs felt very heavy and I was walking and moving very slowly. No stomach discomfort at all.Normally I eat several times between breakfast and lunch, and then again a few times between lunch and dinner. Today, after the shot I did not feel hungry at all. I had lunch at 12:00 noon because I started to feel just a little hungry. It was a turkey burger with a slice of American cheese on two small Mission Zero carb street wraps. I was satiated after that until 4:00 pm when I had half of tonight's dinner which was the exact same turkey burger sandwich I had for lunch. My other half dinner will be Green Giant Simply Steamed riced cauliflower in a light cheese sauce which I will have maybe around 7:00 pm (ONLY IF I'M HUNGRY).. Once again I'm completely satiated, and the lethargy has subsided a little bit too.  So although it's only my first day, and first shot, I'm very pleased with the results so far. I can feel the appetite suppression starting already, which I'm sure will continue and probably even strengthen as I go. Another point of interest is that i took the shot in the muscular part of my upper thigh and I literally could not feel the needle at all. It was completely painless. I was over all pleasantly surprised with Mounjaro today. To be continued............"

My doctor suggested Mounjaro and my wife encouraged me to try it.  They will tell you that it helps you feel full longer.  My experience teaches me that explanation is a severely oversimplified. It has completely and immediately helped me change my relationship with food.  Side effects are minimal.  At first I had cramps and nausea on the night of the injection. I learned to hydrate well for 24 hrs before hand and that is now gone.  The only lingering effect is constipation but its minor and manageable.  Honestly the hardest part is the guilt.

I completely stopped drinking any alcohol, I didn't like the taste and had no desire for it. Your appetite will decrease and you get full really fast, don't keep eating after that or you will be nauseous. That will be your own fault, not the medicine. Pay close attention to the quality of nutrition you ingest because your intake is much lower.  

Constipation isreal, but eat more salads (fiber) and it will be fine. Exercise 3-5 times a week, even if it is just a nice walk. 

I switched to Mounjaro in January (again from a compounding pharmacy, not pre-filled syringes) the depression was better until 7.5mg, in fact I could almost say I had a ""manic"" episode for 3 months with the med combined with B6, then the compounding pharmacy was changed and they mix it with BPC 157 (a peptide that supposedly has unproven positive effects). Within 1 day of the new combination, the mania (shopping compulsion) completely stopped. Now I feel apathetic for the past 2 weeks.
I have lost 11 more pounds in 14 weeks since switching over to the Mounjaro in January. 160 is my weight now, I started at 191.

Hair loss is real (both meds), but I started with a thick head of hair so no one else notices but me. 
Eat enough protein and take hair supplement vitamins. Try to drink enough water, it will help with constipation and dizziness. 

I'm going to switch back to the Mounjaro mixed with the B6, at 5mg to try and feel happier, but hopefully not have the shopping $$$ issue again.

I am thrilled at the 30 plus pounds of weight loss! I can deal with the side effects to have this impossible to lose weight off of me. I am a Nurse Practitioner who has always eaten healthy and exercised 5-7 times per week with NO success ever. Only a severe keto restricted diet took off a few pounds a couple of years ago, but it was impossible to keep up after 6 months of 26 carbs per day limit.

These medicines are life saving. Start slow, eat right and exercise. You will lose weight. It is a miracle in my opinion. Tell your doctors, Nurse Practitioners and friends about these meds.

Another study has shown a reduction in fatal and non-fatal heart attacks AND strokes with Ozempic (Wegovy is the same exact medicine). I put my husband on a small dose of it for his Diabetes, his sugars are 20 points lower and his A1C is now normal for the first time in 20 years. He is still on his Metformin too. Both of our blood pressure levels and triglycerides are in the normal range now.

My A1C kept climbing as well no matter how much I changed my diet. I went up to 2000mg of Metformin and it made me vomit every morning. The next step was insulin. I learned about Mounjaro through a coworker that was using it for weight loss. I started Mounjaro in November 2022 doing the 2.5mg increments every 4 weeks. At the end of January, my A1C went down over 2 points and I lost 20lbs.

I have moved up to the 15mg but had horrible diarrhea and had to drop down to 10mg to give my body a break for a couple of weeks. 
Some pointers to avoid side effects. 
Don’t over eat the day before or day of taking your injection. 
For heartburn and sulfur burps, take gas x and omeprazole as directed. 
Avoid eating heavy meals later in the day. Pay attention to which foods cause you GI symptoms.

Plan to increase to 7.5 for weeks 9 - 12.  Severely obese with HBP, pre-diabetic, high A1C.  Starting weight 234 and I'm down to 210.  Injection is painless for me.  A bit of constipation and maybe some dry mouth, but overall side effects have been very minimal.  Happy with results and feeling healthier already.  I think the way I feel about food on this medication might be the way normal people feel about food all thetime.  It's been shocking to not have cravings, not be starving and not want to eat ALL the cookies.  It's been hard to manage getting the Rx because my doctor has been very hands off and doesn't seem interested in helping me manage this journey.  I plan to have labs done in a couple more weeks to check A1C etc and at that time will have a doctor visit to discuss and ask questions.  I think this drug is new enough that my doc doesn't have any experience with it. So far this has been a game changer for me.  I'm watching what I eat and exercising more, but the difference is that I can manage the food part of this about 1000 times better than I have ever been able to on previous weight loss regimens.  I feel like I can be successful.  Hoping there are no negative long term side effects and that insurance will cover in future for weight loss.  I won't say how much I've been paying per month, but decided I was worth it for 4 months at least if it was working for me.

I weighed approx. 185 at the time. Within two weeks, I knew this application was not right for me. I have at times had the feeling of appetite suppression naturally and as a result of medication, however, this drug seemed to take it to another level. I didn't want food at all, which if you've had experience with needing to lose weight, it's not the way to go. I didn't lose anything in 30 days. Symptom-wise, not much while taking the initial dose of 2.5mg, apart from two incidences of no warning vomiting, and unfortunate for me, these both happened while away from home. The worse of the symptoms came after I stopped. For about 10 days, I had gastro intestinal issues. I also didn't lose any weight; but seemed to gain after coming off of it. I did seek to give Mounjaro one more try thinking maybe it was just the way the first month goes for some, maybe my body calibrating, but when I returned to my doctor, he had no more samples left, and I didn't feel based on the experience/results, that it was worth $1,300.00 to see if another 30 days would make a difference. Also, I remained hydrated through the first month. This is just my experience, but I would rather do the Mediterranean diet, be healthy, be good to my body, then punish it. If it works for you, for health issues especially, terrific! But if it doesn't, find another way. They are out there!"

I off of my insulin and my A1c had dropped. I feel better as well. BUT, I new cannot get by prescribed dose due to more people purchasing for weight loss. My pharmacy cannot get it for diabetics.

I had blood work taking at week 4 and my A1c is up to 10.5??  Which is crazy becuz I can barely eat. Before taking it, I wasn’t a big eater but I’ve been chunky for awhile. 200lbs at 5’7 I’m 47. I have not lost a single pound but I’ve lost my appetite so I’m down to 1 small meal a day. I don’t get much exercise due to other aliments. I’m just wondering if something else is going on? The loss of appetite isn’t a big deal to me, I just don’t understandwhy the weight isn’t coming off? When I took Trulicity for 3 months I lost 15lbs but it all came back on after I stopped it. I don’t know if my hypothyroidism’s is causing this or what. Those levels are very high too. I’m wondering if my doctor ups the Mounjaro maybe that will help. ( I’m still on the 2.5 mg). Oh, the diarrhea and nausea is only bad when I eat rich meals or red meat. I’m honing to schedule another appointment soon to see what doctor says. Id love to know if anyone else is experiencing something similar."

I did the first 2 months at 2.5mg then moved up to the 5mg dose.  I did lose about 20lbs, however there were times I thought I was going to just die.  I was barely able to eat anything much at all without horrible gas and bloating.  At night is when the demons came with the diarrhea like water and dry heaving for hours.  I just say on the toilet with the wastebasket, and was so light headed o could hardly make it back to my bed. I took my last injection 2 weeks ago, I actually have the remaining 2 pens to my husband to throw away, he did so gladly! My Dr wants to try me on the latest medication Wegovy now.  I've just read some of the same horror stories so I'm reconsidering picking it up from pharmacy.

It did not reduce my appetite at all. So the 2nd week my doctor said I can go up to 5mg. I went up to 5mg and I was so sick. I had horrible diarrhea and then my vomiting was awful. I skipped two weeks of getting injections because my vomiting was so bad. So the 5th week I went back and the doctor said she would give me 2.5mg and then gave me another 2.5mg shot to take home and give it a few days after the first shot. This helped reduce my appetite but again, I was vomiting 3-4 days out of the week. I was so nauseated, I had bad acid reflux which I never had before Monjauro and I was miserable. I figured my body just needed to get adjusted to it. I did this a couple of more weeks and was still so sick, 3-4 days of vomiting. I changed my eating habits and focused on proteins and healthier options. I made the decision I am not going to destroy my body taking these injections when my body just can't handle them. I am going to use the tools I learned over these 8 weeks to continue making healthier eating choices, drink tons of water and exercise. I am bummed that the injections did not work for me but I am not going to spend my time vomiting, having constant nausea, diarrhea and all of that has interrupted my sleep and has affected my ability to do my job as well. I will find another way to get this weight off and it won't be with Monjauro."

I was on Ozempic for over a year and could no longer tolerate the GI side affects.  They were terrible.  I was excited to try another medication.  I started on the 2.5 dose on a Tuesday night.  By Thursday afternoon I had GI side affects.  It started with sulfer burps and then progressed to throwing up, diarrhea, stomach cramping, dizziness, light sensitivity.  I had no desire for food and couldn't even stand the smell ofit.  It has been a week and I have been reduced to eating oatmeal and saltine crackers just so that I can function without being in the bathroom constantly.  Today I found out that this medicine can stay in your system for 25-30 days after you stop taking it.  It has already been the longest week of my life.

This drug feels dangerous. Not only did it raise my Thyroid TSH from .91 to 2.48 in only 2 months but my acid reflux is uncontrollable. Prilosec is doing nothing for how bad mounjaro messes up your stomach  and I’m afraid of getting pancreatitis like others or worse thyroid issues causing permanent weight problems. I have only lost 9 pounds in 3 months. I have been eating properly and working out when I don’t feel like total crap from this medicine. I enjoy feeling in control of my food choices and not having sugar cravings but I don’t think that is worth the long term problems this medicine is causing. I learned my lesson from HCG and I’m not riding this wave anymore to find out. I have had headaches (only with 10), horrible acid reflux, with 10mg being to the point of stomach acid constantly coming up in my mouth, lightheaded and feeling like I’m going to pass out on all mg. The appetite suppressant is so strong that it’s counterproductive because I’m not able to eat what I should which is only going to mess with my hormones and metabolic resistance more. I would be very careful taking this if it’s not actually necessary. Not everybody loses mass amounts of weight and not being able to function in the process or ending up with more health issues is not worth it."

Insulin resistance!  Weight gain increased every year.  267 lbs. before my Endocrinologists first prescribed Mounjaro. lost 37 lbs. over first 12 weeks.  High A1C before.  At one point my A1C was 12.  Average A1C was 8.5 to 9.5.  1st 4 weeks dosage was 2.5 mg.  Next 8 weeks using 5 mg.  Recent labs with a result of 6.6.  WOW!  Craving for carbs disappeared.  Eating smaller portions and the foods I once craved 
 (Carbs & desert, etc.) are no longer what I want, nor eat.  Endocrinologist increased my dosage to 7.5 mg for the next 4 weeks.  He will increase dosage to 10 or 12.5 mg after a 4 week review.  My insulin usage was high before starting Maounjaro.  Have reduced daily units of both Levimer and NovaLog.  Reduced NovaLog by as much as 100 units/day.  I've also noticed great improvements in my digestive track.  Prescription stool softer once prescribed is no longer required.  I feel ALIVE now.

Shortly after, Ozempic was hard to fill at my pharmacy and I had gone weeks without it.  It was sporadic at best. Fortunately Mounjaro came along and I was able to get it fulfilled with no problems. On Ozempic, I successfully lost 40 lbs. I had no symptoms. Once I began taking Mounjaro, I felt body aches on the first does for a day, after that, it's been smooth sailing. I have reached my one year point and I am down 100 lbs. I am a 52 year old male, Asian/Pacific Islander decent. You need to make better choices with food consumption or it will not effectively work for you. This has been a lifesaver for me. I have lost a sibling and my father to complications from type 2 diabetes, I did not want to face the same faith. Having changed my diet has made a world of difference. I no longer am sluggish. I no longer have a craving for sugar, I no longer need starch with every meal. I have portion controlled my food but have not stop eating what I enjoy, just not excessively. It's a fantastic drug that has made have a new outlook on life, I no longer dread waking daily and have no issues feeling drowsy during the daytime. I feel fortunate to not have any ill side effects, I hope those of you debating on weather or not to give Mounjaro a try, that you give it your honest attempt. You rarely if ever fell the shot, it's quick and painless, I am not kidding you either. My biggest recommendation is to stay hydrated! You would not believe how well your body will work if you stay hydrated. If you are dehydrated, recognize and replenish. Wishing all of you success in your journey."

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,2/23/2023,KikiAnna,55-64,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,"I have been on this drug since October 11th 2022. It is now February of 2023 and I have lost over 50 lbs. I have found throughout the entire journey of this that it's been incredibly easy to lose weight but I did completely change my eating habits. Because of my type 2 diabetes I am now raw sugar free and I eat low to no carbs. That change in itself I'm sure would have helped me lose weight as I had lost about 14 lb prior to starting on Mounjaro. I started off with the lowest dose and I have only gone to 5 mg and no matter how much I eat right now I am continuing to lose weight. I am not trying to I wanted to try and maintain where I got to. I went from 174 lb to 124 lb and I really don't want to lose anymore. Though I do have to stay on this because of my diabetes I need to learn how to eat more calorically so that that does not feel my stomach up. I can't take eating too much at one time because of the way that the medication works. It is a very good thing but I have noticed now I look like a melted candle and I will need surgery to remove the extra skin. It's not a lot but it is very ugly. I am 61 years old, 5'3"" tall, so I don't have as much collagen and elasticity in my body. I did find a surgeon but now I have to try and come up with $25,000 to get this performed. I don't know where that's going to come from. Check with your insurances before you think they will pay for this. Most of them do not.
I would recommend this injection but with caution. Do it slowly, because that way you may be able to have your skin shrink back more than what mine has not. And I do understand it has to do with my age, but it also has to do with how quickly this weight came off of me. I did start working out also when I started this and it has definitely given me more muscle, but I think this drug eats fat also. But there isn't enough information on what this does to your entire body. And in saying that I do realize that I am one of the guinea pigs for this new type 2 diabetes medication. They do not have long-term data on what happens. I wish they would publish more."

As of today, I am down 36lbs, which is wonderful! I have struggled with my weight since I was a child and I am now 44. I have done ""all"" the diets and had success with most. Mounjaro has been amazing at lowering my appetite and sugar cravings. I am no longer sneaking food, late night snacks or binge eating. I have had mild injection site irritation. I am currently on week 3 of the 7.5mg injection and the side effects have been awful. The first weekI chalked it up to the dose step, the second week the day after my injection I was dizzy, nauseated and had a general malaise feeling. The third 7.5mg injection I totally had to stay in bed the day after. I was so dizzy I couldn't even drive. I have an appointment with my PCP to discuss and hopefully go back down to the 5mg injection since I love the results but can't tolerate the side effects. I can counter act the constipation, deal with the waves of nausea but the dizziness is awful and I don't know what to do. I drink protein shakes, take vitamins and drink 64-98oz of water daily.

I am a nurse and I watched my doctor lose an amazing amount of weight on this before I started it. The main take away here is you can always stop taking it if it doenst work for you or if you feel the side effects are too much so why not give it a try? I will admit the energy level bothers me I simply have none and when you lose weight that should increase not decrease this medication does make you very tired so once I do lose enough I will go off of it even though my doctor thinks a maintenance dose might be needed..I feel energy is needed."

Also, finally, validated that I have PCOS (my doc diagnosed me before the name was normalized many years ago). LOVE this drug. 

The food noise is gone, not feeling hungry all the time. Also observed, I'm calmer and less moody and less stressed. Also observed my mind is more clear, less foggy and I have more energy. I've lost almost 10 lbs in the first week on 2.5mg. The second week is focused on breaking habits, like snacking at a certain time. This drug has transformed my life and I am feeling normal again. I don't binge because I'm afraid I won't get to eat carbs. I also don't have the urge to binge either. I get fully pretty fast. I didn't experience the side-effects others mentioned but am prepared as my dosage goes up. 

I wish insurance would cover the drug for obesity/insulin resistance, since my BMI was 37 and hedging on morbid obesity. I'm paying cash, full price as insurance doesn't cover the drug for my situation. Insurance does cover the drug 100% with a diabetes diagnosis (sad they want us to have a deadly illness vs help prevent, but it's another topic)."

I recently had a routine Endoscopic procedure thatwas stopped early in the process becuase the doctor found food still in my stomach (mind you, I had not eaten solid food 2 days prior and I STILL had food in my stomach).

If I keep my calories around 1000 and exercise everyday, I lose, but if I try to just maintain, the scales go right back up.

But on the flip side my arthritis has improved exponentially. I noticed after about a month that my hands were no longer as swollen and painful as they used to be.

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,1/22/2023,Adam,45-54,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,"50 year old male. Had bariatric sleeve surgery in June ‘20. Went for 341 to 238 in 10 months. My pre-surgery goal was 225lbs. Covid came, stuck at home, parents moved in, sold houses, moved to a different state, yadda yadda. This past Sep I had my physical where I had gone back up to 274. 
Heard about Mounjaro. Tried a sample at 2.5 mg. Made me feel like I did post surgery. Had to make it a point to get 1000-1500 calories in me a day. Today, Jan 22 2023 I weighed in at 224.9lbs. Finally made mygoal weight. So roughly 50lbs in 5 months (now at 10mg). I was told that on the bell curve of results, my level of weight loss usually takes a year. Has it worked so well because of my prior surgery? I don’t know. Like I wrote it has rekindled my the lack of appetite I had post surgery. It’s been life changing. 

Easy of use: Keep refrigerated. Once a week take out pen, take off cap, turn head one half rotation, put on muffin top next to belly button. Hold down plunger until you hear a click. Throw out pen and go about your day. 
Pain of injection: Nonexistent. The first time I administered the drug I thought I messed up because I didn’t feel anything. Pin head blood dot was the only proof I had done it right.
Side effects: Only thing I can notice is I can only go number 2 once or twice a week. Don’t feel constipated, just don’t need to go. Could be the amount of food intake. 

Summation: It’s almost too good to be true. Again, I don’t know if my level success is based off of my prior bariatric surgery or not. If Mounjaro can continue their success, it will make bariatric surgery obsolete."

The very next day I am immediately noticed I wasn’t hungry, which is unusual and welcome. This has really helped me be very healthy in my eating and knowing I was on it made me resist times to overeat that I would have. I have medicare and private company insurance so I thought I would have to pay full price but was going to try a month anyway as it is so very hard for me to lose any weight. When I mentioned to the Walgreen pharmacist that I hadthe Lily coupon but I knew I was not eligible (retired, 69) he said let me see it, sometimes it helps some anyway and it knocked price down to $450! I was so excited! Only side effect has been minor “heartburn” like symptoms and light headaches I think are from low calories. I have been eating Nutritarian for 10 years anyway but now cutting out the bread and cheese (ugh) I had snuck in. Near end of week 2. Start 191, now 184, bg 85.

The thing I want to warn everyone about is make sure your doctor keeps an eye on your TSH levels. I have had thyroid cancer and had too have mine remover. Have been on Levothyroxin for 20 years and my TSH has been just fine. On Mounjaro it has gone out of sight. I only loss maybe 10 lbs over the 3 months I was taking it.How that I have stopped taking it now I feel like I have been on a high and now crashing  all I wat to do is sleep and I also am having a bad headache. Just be careful if you do not have a thyriod.

No real side effects other than it can make you feel uncomfortable after you eat ( burping / full) especially the first couple days after injection. Plan to stay at current dose.

Started Thanksgiving week on 2.5 mg, by Christmas I was down 11 lbs. Started 5mg this week and am down a total of 17 lbs in 8 weeks. Nausea, heartburn, and gas would be my bad symptoms,  but having no appetite at all would be the positive symptom."
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,1/13/2023,Kate in the UK,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,"Ok here goes. I am 48 Female starting weight 210. Diagnosed prediabetic. I started off with Ozempic and got up to 1mg from March 2022 thru July 2022 and got down to about 185 by August. Then switched to mounjaro starting at the 2.5 for 4 weeks; 5mg for four weeks; 7.5 for 8 weeks. I should have stayed at 7.5mg!!!

That said I am down from a dress/pants size if 16 to a size 8 now! Yesssssss.  I have only ever had one side effect ::: the itchy welt that gets red at injection site it lasts all weekand it is insanely itchy. Crazy crazy maker itchy. Sometimes it shows up right away some times it takes 8-24 hours to show up but it is max max max itchy and so uncomfortable. Also the pen sucks so much. I hate the injection pen with a vengence. It’s awful!! There is no need for this over wrought contraption. The Ozempic pen was small and discreet and easy to carrry in purse. It also was not painful. This mounjaro pen HURTS! And it’s clunky and huge! I hate it. Ok well anyway. I am down to 156lbs now from 210. I am on week 4 of 10mg. And I have to say the past three weeks after injection I have had a horrendous horrendous experience with “food poisoning like” violent vomit. VIOLENT vomiting. Throwing up water even. It’s insane. Now I don’t know if it was actual food poisoning the first week on 10mg. So the next weeek it happens again and I think maybe it was stomach flu. And then third week was last week and I think maybe. It was the recall on a product I consumed. I just took my 4th 10mg shot today three hours ago. 

I am already feeling slightly nauseous and have had a BM and some loose stool. So now drinking water. The itchy welt hasn’t shown up yet on my thigh. I’m waiting to see if I have the vomit reaction again this weekend or god willing it doesn’t happen. I would really hate to have to stop taking this medication as it is life changing and a god send. Truly. 

I have PCOS and close to fifty and have not been able to lose the weight thru diet and exercise and I can not tolerate stimulant drugs like Phentermine. They are awful. Please god I hope. I don’t get sick on this. ???????????????? please let this work this week without getting deathly sick. If I do- I will ask to go back down to 7.5mg. Or 5mg. Whatever it takes. Also I am taking naltrexone and bupropion daily for weightloss as well but really not sure how much either of those do anything for the weightloss. I’ll tell ya though I noticed that some dairy products always smell spoiled to me. Even when. They are not. So that is weird. That might be from the meds or it could be a side effect from Covid I read tho I never tested positive for Covid nor have I ever had it from what I can tell. 

I’ll post an update after this weeekend to see if I am able to survive the battle of vomit and diarrhea. Wish me luck. ??"

I was blotchy and purple in color from severe dehydration. An allergic reaction to this medicine put my system into DKA(diabetic keroacidosis) this throws your whole system out of wack.

I have a COMPLETELY different opinion of this medication after being moved up to and completing a month of the 5 mg dosage. 
I am baffled at the results! My blood sugar has leveled off and is no longer spiking and dropping, my blood pressure has also stopped responding to uncontrolled BS levels and is back to normal, and I have lost 12.4 lbs this month. 
I have not had the [horrible] side effects that many people have reported but I have noticed a difference in my energylevel overall since I began taking this medication. I am often sluggish and fatigued. Coconut water (4oz) daily to replace electrolytes seems to be helping.

My doctor wanted me to try this medication. I went from 215lbs to 149lbs.  I have had fatty liver for over 10 years and after my most resent abdominal CT it's totally gone.  I am currently taking 12.5mg however I will be going back to 2.5mg for maintenance.  This has been a game changer for me.  I know people get upset about non-diabetics taking this medication however there are people out there with other ailments that this drug can help. This drug can be used to prevent Type 2 diabetes.  I'm happy for anyone that can take this and change their lives.  It should be noted that you have to be committed to a lifestyle change.  Yes this medication helps you lose weight easily and quickly however if you don't watch what your eating and continue to exercise the weight loss will only be temporary.  This is a great tool to get you on track.  Don't look at is as an easy way to get thin.  (Just my advise)

Started First Dose.

Almost within an hour felt a lower sense of hunger.
But out of habit, I ate my normal size dinner a few hours later and felt bloated, almost nauseous.

Then, Friday nite had rib eye, salad & whiskey.  Later that nite, I felt ill - very ill, on the verge of puking. 

Sat, tired very low energy, not sure if it's the shot.  Sunday, I ate much less than normal portions, still a little sick.  Even skipped lunch, as was not in the mood. Felt better.

Thiscontinued off/on til the second shot.  Then I realized the sick feelings were due to consuming massive quantities of food, fat & alcohol.  Once I reduced this to half of what i was used to (it took a few weeks to achieve), I was no longer sick if I consumed smaller amounts.  And cut back on alcohol.

Does this shot reduce drinking too??  

It's now been six weeks.  I've lost 12 POUNDS.  My energy is increasing.  Even though I'm eating Half of what I used to (and better-balanced meals) food really tastes better than before.  And without dreaming about what I was going to eat from my waking moment to nite time.

The side effects are:
You will be ill if you overeat and drink, in various ways, on various days.
Constipation made me adjust food to include more fiber, eating dates, etc.  
Burping more than normal, but no big deal.
- A few days here and there, had diarrhea, minor headaches, and some of the symptoms others have listed, BUT, they all go away or reduce as soon as I adjusted my intake.

Two Days before the next shot, My desire to eat increases a little.

I've tried to step up to the 5 mg, but everyone is sold out ....nationwide. Yes, called all around the country.

At first, I was frustrated by that, but I realized that today's scarcity will increase supply and it will lower prices as well.

I need to lose 60 lbs to eliminate my diabetes & Meds & CPAP.
I've felt this was an impossible goal in the last ten years.
I'm now down 12 lbs and I can see the reality of getting my life back to some prior normalcy.  
And I don't want to Die.

I can see not even having to use this med in the future as well.

I really want to go to the next (5mg) level.  
This is a life changer."

My ankles and feet swell and my joints just hurt. I weighed 211lbs when I went to the Dr. 2 months ago asking for help. I'd never heard of mounjaro and was expecting phentermine (that was prescribed to me in the past). She put me on the 2.5mg. Prior to using, when i would wake up the first thought went to food, but afterthe 1st dose it was like a switch flicked and my cravings and appetite did a 180°..the 2nd,3rd, and 4th dose side effects were intense to say the least..I take my dose Saturday night, the Sunday after was BRUTAL, I literally stayed in bed and slept the whole day because just opening my eyes made my head hurt and the nausea was unimaginable..I seriously considered discontinuing the medicine, the side effects did get less severe and the last 2 weeks I didn't experience any of the discomfort I had before...I think your body just has to adjust and everyone is different..I have to FORCE myself to eat now and I'm only able to get down about a half cup of whatever it is..I have found (if your having trouble eating) that eating bland foods is easiest to get down (crackers, toast etc.,) and I've also not had trouble eating fresh fruits and veggies..but anything sugary or salty is a NOGO. I go back to my dr. Jan. 6th for an ""official"" weigh-in but I'm down from 211 to 190 in less than 2 months and haven't had a single flair up from my auto immune issue....hope this helps. And I pray Eli Lily doesn't restrict non-diabetics...being overweight can cause diabetes, its not just a treatment after you get diabetes, its  preventive care to stop it before it happens..obesity is a HUGE problem in America..this is a game changer.

Family history of type 2, gastric sleeve 6 years ago and gained over half the weight back. Battled obesity most of my life. High blood pressure now and high cholesterol.  Hope to post more with the success I had but wanted to share that first day had some anxiety lying in bed and watching a movie with my spouse and felt no cravings like popcorn. Woke up the next morning feeling the same, but more intense with the feeling of no feeling hungry first thing in the morning. It has definitely curbed my appetite and with a little exercise, my doctor believes this will be a huge success, and so do I! Next month doctor will increase medication to 5mg.

I have tried noom, dietician, exercise and many other things to try and do on my own. I did lose a little but not enough to improve my A1c which was 8.3. I can hardly believe I have been on 2.5 for 9
Days and am down 8 pounds. This seems unreal but I have really focused on a strict way of eating lean protein, veggies Ana healthy carbs. I was a huge sweet eater and now no desire to eat sweet and feel like I have no relationship with food only using food to fuel my body. I did have a few side effects in beginning headache, Naseau but Dr explained why I had headache and ibuprofen worked great! I guess when you have hyperinsulimia you have elevated amount in your brain causing sugar cravings and I feel better when it was explained to me. I do have a dietician and you really have to eat like a gastric bypass patient. I hope my A1c levels go down and happy with weight rapid weight loss.

I started with 2.5 mg and have slowly increased to 7.5 mg and have lost a total of 30 pounds. This month I am increasing to 10 mg. This medicine has lessened my cravings for sugar and carbohydrates. If I try to eat something sweet, it takes sickeningly sweet, and anything salty tastes super salty. Side effects I have had are nauseousness, constipation, diarrhea, and heartburn. I have alleviated most ofthose symptoms by giving my shot in my thigh and in the morning.  I have also learned that not eating anything too late helps.  This medicine has been a life changer for me and I am hoping when I do my blood work next month my cholesterol will be down.

I started mounjaro 8 weeks ago starting with the 2.5 dosage and lost 5 pounds. My next prescription was increased to 5.0 and have lost another 10 pounds. My weight loss goal is 130 and have 15 pounds to go. I get nauseous if I eat more than 1/2 a cup and I do not have any cravings for anything sweet or salty like I did before. The first couple of days after injection I do get nauseous but it does go away. My weight loss journey began 5 years ago and I was 210. I usually go up and down in my weight by 20 pounds and can’t get lower than 150. Even at 5’1 I’m still considered overweight. That I have been able to lose so much weight is amazing. I love not having to take pills like when I was on metformin. This is definitely a game changer.

Now I hear that Eli Lilly cracking down on prescriptions unless for diabetes. Praying this is not the case. This has taken away cravings and anxious eating habits and I’ve lost a total now of 37 lbs. Could not have done it without Mounjaro, honestly believe. Please Eli Lilly, DO NOT DO AWAY WITH DISCOUNT CARD for obesity OR diabetes! One is related to the other !"

I do not plan to use any longer as I lost the weight I needed to. I started on 2.5 and then 5.0 and then 7.5. It is WELL worth anyone to use that needs to lose weight and then they can exercise and keep it off once you no longer take the medicine.

But the side effects, I don't know if its worth it. I am on 7.5 and have been taking it for 9 weeks. I have migraines the first few days after the shot. These are debilitating migraines. Then I have nerve pain in my left foot. It started out as just a small spot. Each shot increases the area of the pain. The whole top of my left foot, side of ankle and now the back of my whole left calf. My clothes rub against it and I just cry in pain. I can push againstit and not move and there is no pain but the light rubbing, its excruciating pain. So keep taking it and have it possibly spread and get worse, but have my A1C keep going down, lose more weight, get off my cholesterol medication OR get rid of the nerve pain and migraine and keep the weight-well keep fighting it, stay on medication for cholesterol and struggle with my A1C.

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,12/1/2022,M Saunders,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,This medication has changed my life. It has changed my relationship with food and allowed me to train my mind what is enough. I never would have been able to do it on my own. I tried and it never worked.
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,12/1/2022,AA1 in Georgia,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,2.0,1,3,2,1.0,0,"I am a 46 year old B/F and I have completed my first 4 injections of Mounjaro 2.5mg. 

I am a full-time police officer and have a moderately active life. I have followed my physician’s instructions to the letter because I want this to work for my health not simply for weight loss. 

Before beginning Mounjaro, I was on a steady loss and was down 9 pounds in one month (from my last office visit) doing nothing outside of my normal routine of eating lean protein, large amounts of raw vegetables andfruits (strawberries, blueberries, apples, oranges, and grapefruit only), drinking half my body weight in ounces of water, and walking/jogging 2.5 miles 5 days a week.

This method has helped me lose a total of 85 lbs from Dec 2019 to December 2021. I gained 30 pounds back plateauing out and maintaining 220-225 pounds (size 14 women’s clothing 36-38W in men’s law enforcement clothing). 

However, I was been fighting sugar cravings and having a hard time staying [full] after eating before I felt like I was starving again. I was gaining belly fat which is unusual for me. I was falling asleep at weird times throughout the day and having swelling in my legs and feet with numbness in my arms and hands. 

After trying several methods to treat my symptoms, which point to diabetes, my doctor decided to try me on Mounjaro.

Many of her patients have shown outstanding results. They also have side effect horror stories that made me a little skeptical… and nervous to be honest.

I, on the other hand, can not share the success stories so far. Where others lost between 12 - 17 pounds in the first month, and lowered their A1C. 

I have gained two pounds and my labs are the same. After being on a steady loss, I am a bit disappointed BUT I did not experience the ongoing series of side effects that they had either! Thankfully.

My digestive system stopped working normally after the first injection. I did not have a BM for 2 days! Uh, NO. 

Typically, I have normal, regular bowel movements shortly after eating a meal and urinate out the correct amount of fluids from what I take in. I am now urinating twice as much and my bowel movements declined to small and not as frequent. I am experiencing dehydration now, too. 

I increased my (raw or ground) ginger intake and added prunes to my diet every morning and evening. This has helped tremendously with getting my regularity back to normal. 

I have had no other “expected” side effects outside of the digestive issues but I do have very specific food cravings that I never had before. Now my sweet craving is chocolate candy with caramel and my new, completely weird craving is chicken (fried) fillet sandwich with mustard…. What is this??? I absolutely have not experienced loss of appetite! 

I get tired easily and can barely complete my 2.5 ml walks. Jogging is completely out of the question since the first injection.

After my visit Tuesday (11-29-2022) my physician decided to increase me to the 5 mg dose. I’m willing to try one more month but if I don’t see improvement, I will not be continuing this medication for a third month. 

I am fairly disappointed with my results overall."

C peptide results show I make plenty of insulin.  I believe my large waist and fatty liver are largely responsible for my insulin resistance. I also have dawn syndrome...again liver issues. Also believe I had undiagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome for years.  My irregular periods miraculously became regular at 38 when I was started on metformin
 
This new drug has given me the best results for my insulin resistance overall to date. Some nausea and burping that pass after second day following dosing.

binge extremely hard, then starve myself the next day. I would think about food every minute, every second, looking at the clock wondering when I can eat again (even when i wasn’t hungry).

Lots of nausea and general gastric uneasiness.  Takes away appetite to the point that I don't eat and can't recognize hunger symptoms until I get weak with hunger.

Start weight 245
Current weight 230
Start A1C 7.0

I started Mounjaro at the 2.5 dose. Week 2 I noticed my appetite had subsided tremendously and when I ate,  I had to be careful or I would feel overly full. I had no side effects until after my 3rd weeks dose. Then I had terrible diarrhea and cramping with gas, bloating and belching. It cleared up after 3 days and I thought maybe I caught a flu bug. I missed my follow up appointment so I couldn't get a refill and had to go off themedicine for 3 weeks and start over again at the 2.5 dose. 
The second time on 2.5, I had no side effects but I also felt no difference in my appetite like the first time on the drug. I was still overly hungry being on a diet so my next visit, my doctor increased me to 5.0 and I was excited! Until week 2. 

Again, I suffered the same side effects for a full 4 days!! I had to switch to a liquid diet until it finally cleared up today. I've been taking Imodium AD as well. I think I'm ready to try toast tomorrow. 

Now I see why so many people lose weight on this drug! I went 4 days with less than 500 calories per day and still keeping my full work routine at a very physical job. 

I'm not sure if it's really worth the weight loss but I'm going to try and continue because getting rid of my diabetes is extremely important."

I have noticed a decrease in appetite, lost weight and at 2 inches from my waste. Despite the terrible things that may happen with the drug, thyroid cancer, it very important to lower my AC1 and not be tagged with the TYPE 2 designation which can result in unfavorable life insurance premiums.

I lost an additional 5 for a total of 10 for the 2 weeks I seem to be on the right dose now. My home A1C test shows 5.5. So I seem to be coming back to the Victoza level before starting all this. Hope everyone else is doing well. I will post again in December

Using Mounjaro 5mg subcutaneous injections once a week. 
On 6/23/2022 my A1c was 11.7% 
On 8/24/2022 my A1c was 8.4%
On 9/17/2022 my A1c was 7.1% 
And last lab test on performed on 10/21/2022 my A1c lowered to 5.5% 
I lost about 25 pounds in this interval that was not needed because I was not overweight but yes with belly fat that I lost completely. 
This was in combination with Metformin 500mg twice a day and Atorvastatin 10mg once a day. 
Didn’t make any specific diet orexercises just cut sugar beverages like sodas and juices, also candies and chocolates. 
So at least for me they worked perfectly and now that I reached my A1c goal most likely the doctor will tell me to stop using it."

In 14 weeks of taking this medicine I have decreased my A1C considerably. My sugar levels no longer spike after eating. I have lost 33 lbs since starting at a weight of 228lbs. I have been strict on not consuming bread, potatoes, pasta, and rice. With my doctor’s approval,  I have been supplementing my diet and decreased appetite with an organic plant based probiotic protein drink that also contains 50 super foods. I feel great and my energy levels are greatly improved.  I hope to be able to continue this medicine but worry when Lily no longer allows their incentive pricing program that I am utilizing. I believe that Lily allows these incentives for 9 months but hoping they will continue this program as Mounjaro has totally changed my life, my overall health and my approach of diet/food choices. I have tried many programs, diets, and medicines in the past and nothing has given me the willpower and success like Mounjaro."

I was 335 pounds at the start of meds. After a month I lost 22 pounds. 22! I was able to not only eat less, but my cravings for bad foods: high sugar, fastfood, fatty foods has pretty much gone down completely. My body no longer was happy if I ate bad things (cramping, gas, nausea, diarrhea). When I ate well balanced small meals with protein, lots of veggies and rice I was fine. I’m able to eat about 1/3 or less of the normal amount of food I was eating and I wasn’t eating more than 2,250 calories a day before medication. Due to medical conditions I have and other medications I’m on, I was not able to lose weight after initially losing 100lbs on my own. I’m now at 5mg injections and 26 pounds down at 5 weeks. 
This medication isn’t a magical fix. But it gives you the chance and time to make change by lowering your hunger, to find healthy foods you like that will fill you up. So you can stick with it for the long run. It gives you the ability to create a healthy lifestyle. This medication has changed my life. The only issues I’ve had are headaches, severe nausea and cramping mainly after eating heavy or larger portions of food. The benefits outweigh the side effects for me. Also if you are struggling to get this medication paid for by insurance have your doctor send it to a specialty pharmacy or have your pharmacy apply the mounjaro saving card for a years worth at $25 a month. It’s worth it."

I am a little dizzy from time to time.  Came to this site to see if others feel as great as I do after only one injection. Not sure how or why it has helped mood.  Didn’t know my mood needed help.  I thought my actual antidepressant was working fine.  But dang this stuff is amazing.  I wonder if it is positively interacting with my Wellbutrin and Trintellix.   Side note: zero desire to eat.

My blood sugar went from the 3 hundreds down to The low hundreds. I haven't experienced any insight effects that I know of. I am absolutely Is esthetic about this medication.

Hb high cholesterol prediabetic etc. After reading reviews I was nervous about side effects - asked doc for zofran just in case of nausea. No need so far
Injection was easier than taking pill. No pain. First 2 days even thought of food made me queasy. No other side effects! I am taking Metamucil every day to protect against constipation. I do have daily diahhera but prob from Metamucil. I force myself to eat small portions of foodsuch as half hard boiled egg, half cup applesauce. Drink meal replacement every am. No appetite.
Some muscle pain but since I am drinking soo much water I assume it's electrolyte imbalance. Add salt half teaspoon of sugar to cup of water to alleviate - it helps. 
I am beyond happy so far. Just to have my obsession with food gone is a relief. Eat to live not live to eat. It is only costing me 50.00 per week with insurance so far - when dose goes up hope price doesn't go with it. Just moving around bending over etc has been so hard at my obese weight. I want to feel better and be healthier - this isn't about vanity. Type 2 diabetes is a family curse. If you can afford this medication try it."

Only negative is constipation the week I up the dose.  Going to 7.5 next week.   I am very pleased with this medication.   It is easy to administer.  I have to remember to eat.  Food tastes great, but need to eat small meals. Lost all cravings.   I consider this like a chemical gastric bypass.  If I overeat, I do feel ill.  Make sure you eat 3 meals a day, just smaller meals.  I am staying around 1200 cals a day.    Mydaughter is starting on Mounjaro soon after seeing my happiness with it."

I started mine at 5mg at the beginning of august.
At first I seemed to have lost 5-7lbs. But now I am on dose 10 and feel as though I’ve gained weight. 
My body typically needs the higher dose of things to have it work effectively. 
I only experienced the loss of appetite one week out of the 10 weeks I’ve been on it. I’m hoping it all starts to work once I up my dose more. 
I wish we could comment to each other on here"

I'm moving to 12.5mg for 4 weeks and then finally to the final 15.0mg for however long I have to stay on this stuff.

16 weeks in and I've dropped from 279 to 258.  That part feels great.  Fairly consistent 1-2 lbs per week.  My appetite is way down, I have to force myself to eat.

Side effects for me at the 2.5-7.5mg dosage were negligible, only real thing was lack of appetite.  However, since I've been at 10mg, my injection day side effects are considerable.  Brain fog, anxiety, increased heart rate, constipation, vomitting.  It starts about 6 hours after the injection and lasts the rest of the day.  I plan to change from injection first thing in the morning to late in the day, hoping that I sleep through most of those bad hours.  We'll see.

My concern is that if I'm having issues at 10mg, what will 12.5 and 15.0 be like.  I guess I'll find out.

My reason for taking this was to control my A1c and get off Metformin.  I was on 2000mg per day of Metformin, had terrible GI issues, and still had a 7.9 A1c.   I now take zero Metformin, and my A1c is already down to 6.4 and falling."

I have been on Victoza for several years and was getting tried of the daily injections and 150$ monthly price tag.  It had been very good at keeping my A1C at 5.4.   I also take 500mg of ER Metformin  
My weight had risen during COVID to 276 from 235. Not being able to swim a mile every other day and not changing my eating habits caused this. Stress was also a factor.    
During August at 2.5mg I had no side effects and none of the appetite suppression others talk about here.  My A1C went out of control to 6.1. My doc increased the dose to 5 mg after 4 weeks. I still did not have any side effects and no weight loss.  My 3rd A1C did drop to 5.9.  I am now on 7.5 week1 and continue to take 500mg metformin.  Now the side effects others mentioned have kicked in. Severe loss of appetite. I have been following a Keto diet with 50 g a day of carbs in form of veggies and some fruit. Still no weight loss. My body seems to be really stubborn.  I do have lots of energy. My job has me walking and on my feet 8 hours a day 3 miles a day.

I am starting to have more of an appetite now, and its becoming harder to keep my calorie intake that low, but if I don't, I gain a lb or 2 back. I have had no side effects from the meds, which makes me wonder if I am really having any effects? Ionly have about 10-15 lbs to lose, so maybe the weight isn't coming off as fast for me because I am not really obese. ? IDK.

The directions state to follow a healthy diet, drink a lot of water and exercise. I eat ""clean"" - no sugar, no processed foods, no simple carbs and no artificial sweeteners. I do HIIT 3 times a week. I always have water with me. My provider's instruction was to take small bites-eat slow; I think this helps with your stomach not dumping its contents into the small intestines which can cause gastric issues. I was also told to eat minimal fat. I have dysregulation of my appetite hormones and Mounjaro helps with that. I finally know what felling full is like and I am able to feel real hunger.  I feel my hormones are behaving like a ""normal"" person's hormones. I have ""break through"" food issues around day 5 so I am learning to ride that wave until it passes. I hope Lily puts this through to the FDA for more than a diabetic medication. And if so I hope the FDA approves it for alternative uses."

I’ve been on the lowest dosage for four weeks. The first two weeks it caused severe G.I. upset. It has severely suppress my appetite to where I can’t even eat. I try to drink as much water as possible and stick to shakes because solid foods make me gag. My fourth week because of my low calorie intake and lack of fluids I went into hypoglycemic shock. My view of the shot is if you can tolerate it and you can force yourself to eat anddrink fluids like you’re supposed to it probably works just fine. However I cannot continue the shot. I see a lot of good positive reviews and that’s great but I think as more and more people get on the shot for all types of reasons you’re going to see other issues with it.

It's October and I am up to the 10mg dosage.  I do get the occasional stomach ache, followed by diarrhea, which stops the stomach ache immediately.  I have noticed this usually happens two days after the shot. I am drinking a lot of water and taking Metamucil every other day.  Losing weight in a healthy manner, with ease.  I am eating a very healthy diet. My labs now show normal bp, LDL and HDL, A1C etc.  I am very happy with the results so far!  It hasbeen a struggle to drink enough water- I have to remember to add more every time there is an episode of diarrhea."

I moved to 10 mg this week and I find the higher dose suppresses my appetite a lot. When I eat too much I am miserable and with the 5mg I did that a time or two. My appetite with the higher dose is just not there. I am having to make myself eat a little bit. I have no burps or nausea or anything else when I am not eating much. 

Thanks to Lilly for this drug. I can tell this is going to change my life."

I find that on Mounjaro I am loosing weight at a steadier pace and it has really helped me train my body and mind to eat the appropriate foods. Fish, chicken, veggies and grains (good grains) I cut out almost all processed foods as well as lactose and gluten. I also cut way back on alcohol (maybe 1-2 drinks a week). I’m shouting to anyone who will listen, how great I feel both physically and mentally!!! My energy is off the charts. I’ve lost 33lbs and have 30 more to go.

I have just completed first week at 5mg after 4 weeks on 2.5mg. I am a 66 yr old female and I am now down 13lb in 5 weeks. I am very happy taking Mounjaro and have had few side effects. However, I do not believe my good results are entirely an accident, and are related to the intentional lifestyle changes I am working very hard and intentionally to follow. The reduction in appetite has allowed me to reduce my food consumption by what I estimate is 50% to 66%.Basically, I think I was previously just eating constantly, snacking all day, and eating way too much. I have also increased my daily exercise to at least 60+ min daily and push myself to drink 6 to 8 12oz glasses of water daily. My morning blood sugar is now consistently under 100 after starting at 170, so this is very exciting to me. I also avoid junk food and simple carbs. If I was not doing all this, I can easily see myself having gastro issues and headaches,from poor food choices or getting dehydrated. I understand that everyone can have adverse reaction to a certain med. Many years ago had a severe reaction to prednisone and had to stop. It was just not the right med for me. Mounjaro is working very well for me so far, in conjunction with my eating and exercise habit changes. Will update at the end of Oct."

I have been starving for long term usage info, maybe from someone who was in a clinical study but I still can't find it.  Maybe they sign something stating that they will not discuss their experience on social media in return for the free drugs and treatment?  Anyhow, even though I have more questions than answers, I'd like to share a tiny bit of my experience to help anyone who may be in the shoes I was in several months ago.  Overall (for me):  Itworks great, quite simply, it's a miracle!  With that being said, it's not easy.  Most days I'm elated.  I've never had such success and felt so good.  However, one day I had to fight to not have to go to the ER ....I let myself become dehydrated and maybe undernourished.  You must drink and keep eating.  But you live and learn.  I'm fine...more than fine.  I've been put on a maintenance dose which I have mixed feelings about because I'm only 8 pounds from my goal weight but my dr is being cautious.  Conclusion:  So far, more good than bad even though I've had many days of extreme fatigue....I think about the expensive gym memberships accompanied with diets that I tried and failed over SO many years and I'll take this over that ANY day!  But now, on a very personal note, I'm terrified because after experiencing the best summer of my life, finally close to a happy, healthy weight and lifestyle, I understand that experts say that the medication has to be continued otherwise the weight comes back without the strict discipline that I obviously was lacking pre-mounjaro.  I guess I was silly to think otherwise and I'd be happy to take the injection only once a week because I don't even feel it AT all...but insurance won't cover it and it's over a grand a month...OUCH...now that hurts.  I'm just glad I got to experience the benefits while possible.  Maybe someday this will be something that is available for everyone.  It really should be!  I really believe this drug or future versions have the ability to change the world."

The first few weeks I didn't lose any weight & had mild bloating and belching.  After the 5th week I vomitted several times and had diarrhea for a few days.  My doctor told me to stop, which I did.  11 days after my last injection and I am in hell.  Diarrhea for the 3 days and I don't mean occasional.  I'm talking about 30 times a day.  If I eat as much as one Saltine cracker my stomach rumbles like crazy, bloats up like a balloon and off to the bathroom I go. I'm sure people will lose weight if everything you eat you comes out either end right away.  The stomach pain is too much.  Hopefully this will resolve itself soon.  I'd rather die a few years earlier than have to live like this for a year or more while taking Mounjaro.  Good luck to everyone on this site.  Hopefully you'll have better luck than me.  I'm out."

Now due to Mounjaro my sugar levels are close to normal and I have lost 10 pounds in a month!!! I have had some terrible side effects but find its well worth it.  My Doctor wants to keep me on the 2.5 due to he is afraid it will cause my sugar to drop to low.  
I seem to get sick the night I take my shot and am sick  for about a day and a half before I start feeling better, again I still find it worth fighting through the side effects to get control of my life again.

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,10/4/2022,LS,35-44,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,"This medication works. I’ve never been able to lose weight so consistently. I’ve been taking it for about 6 weeks now and am currently on the 5mg dose. Total weight loss so far: 13 pounds (201 ??188). That’s right, 13 pounds in just six weeks. Blows my mind! ?? In 2017, I lost 30 pounds over 9 months. I starved and sweated for every single one of those pounds, but they all came back the next year. I’ve tried keto, paleo, Jenny Craig, Noom - you name it, I’ve probably tired it. About 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with PCOS and it’s been a constant (losing) battle to lose weight and keep it off. I’ve been pre-diabetic several times, have elevated LDL, metabolic syndrome, etc. This medication is a game changer. One of the craziest things is I actually crave healthy foods. Yeah, you read that right. Fruits, veggies, lean protein are all I want to eat. Fried, fatty foods actually taste horrible and make me feel even worse, so it’s not hard to stay away from them. I’m no longer a slave to my sugar and carb cravings. I’ve also had IBS for over 10 years. My gut is so much happier eating smaller, healthier meals. After these meals, I am satisfied and I feel good. No more after lunch fatigue for this lady! 

Having said all of that, nothing is perfect. If someone tells you that, kick them in the shin and run because they are a dirty, rotten liar. Here are some things I’ve struggled with on the medication and how I’ve learned to manage the (minimal) side effects. First, take the medication the night before a day you can just relax. I take mine on Saturday evening because I always have Sundays off. If the medication makes me feel a bit sick, it’s always the day after the injection. Eat small, low fat meals and eat slowly. Protein shakes (plant based specifically) are also a good option. Second, water and FIBER! I can’t say it enough. Drinks tons of water and eat lots and lots of fiber. Take a fiber supplement. Whatever you need to do, because the constipation is real. Water helps with the constipation and the cotton mouth - win, win. 

I hope this review helps any of you thinking about taking the Mounjaro plunge. Go for it. ??"

I am having a little bit of constipation, but that's an easy fix. A little dry mouth, but it encourages me to drink more water. Appetite has been reduced 80%. Weird part is that I don't want many carbie foods. I am craving salads and veggies and stuff that I normally do not crave. I think because of the dry mouth, I don't want warm foods, maybe that's why I am craving salads? Its weird, but I like it really well so far.

Biggest I’ve ever gotten and blood pressure up. I was so close to having diabetes as well. Started using Mounjara the first week of August and every 4 weeks went up 2.5mg. I just took my first dose of 7.5mg 3 nights ago. This medicine makes me slightly nauseous but the Dr prescribed Zofran for me to take. It works great. I have had horrible constipation and what finally worked was using 2 tbsp of Benefiber powder daily. I also got to where I was up to 3 stool softeners, probiotics, prunes, water, laxatives….you name it. I can’t get dependent on laxatives and thank God the Benefiber worked. Last night I was awakened at 2:30am with bad nausea. My first time actually vomiting and the other end part. I just don’t know if it’s the stomach virus that is going around or the Mounjara. When I take a shot at night, I take a Zofran as well. Then the first thing the next morning before anything else, I take another Zofran. But that was it because I felt okay on the 7.5mg until my episode this morning. I will take one more dose of the 7.5mg and see if this happens again. If so, I will be going back down to 5mg. OH….and 2 months in I have lost a total of 30lbs!  This is working so I want to keep using it. Just not at the expense of being sick from a higher mg. I’ll take it slow."

My results so far:  I weighed 210lbs when I started and currently weigh 180lbs, so I am pretty pleased with that 30lb loss.  I had no side effects up to the 7.5 dose.  However, this past week on the 10mg dose I have started to feel the abdominal pain, constant belching, bloated feeling and general gassiness that others have shared.  I will take my next dose, but if the symptoms continue, I will probably ask to go back to the 7.5 dose.  I am waiting for results of a complete blood workup, which will be available this week.

My doctor and I have tried several different meds hoping to combat insulin resistance and overweight (I'm prediabetic) to no avail (Ozempic, Rybelsus, etc.) as well as thyroid support.  Mounjaro is the first time I have felt an actual physiological difference.  Hunger and cravings are greatly reduced, particularly on days 1-5, less so on day 6 and 7.  I have experienced few side effects.  Initially, I had a slight headache but that has resolved.  The only other side effect is my own doing when I don't take in enough calories/protein and get nauseated or fatigued.  That doesn't happen if I eat small portions more frequently.  I begin 5mg next week and am excited to see the results."

No issues with liquid intake. Since titrating up to the 5mg I have been waking up on day 2 following the injection with sulfur burps, stomach bloating and cramping, and diarrhea.

Very excited & motivated to keep on going.  Type 1 Diabetes/insulin dependence is prevalent in my family history and I would like to avoid any more on-set than I already have had with elevated A1C readings & being diagnosed as pre-diabetic.  My Dr. believed I was a prime candidate for Monjauro.  It seems I've encountered most of the issues that everyone else has with some headaches, nausea, stomach rolling, burping at times and occasional diarrhea or constipation. It usually affects me 2-3 days after taking the injection.  With the consistent progress I have made, I feel like it's worth the discomfort I have experienced at those times.  No appetite or cravings, ever, so I supplement with protein shakes & only eat balanced, small meals. I've noticed my energy level is kicking back in so this next week I'll begin walking & working out.  I'm 64, 5'5"" and began my journey at almost 192 lbs.  Already being back into the 180's so soon helps me realize that this is doable.  Not having an appetite (for the most part) has really allowed me to focus on portion control and removes the urge to grab unhealthy food/snacks.  It's been eye-opening, in comparison, to remember just how many calories I was consuming on a daily basis that were useless and put my future health at risk.  I feel I've learned a very valuable lesson to pull in the reins and make myself accountable for my choices in my eating habits.  Kudos to us all for going on this adventure and I wish everyone success and good health!"

With Mounjaro I have had terrible side effects. Bloating, stomach pain, acid reflux, indigestion, brain fog, exhaustion and on day 5 massive diarrhea all day long andin the middle of the night. No appetite. No cravings. I drink lots of water. I feel like I’m going through a colon clean out before having a colonoscopy lol. I’m trying to remain positive because I love the weight loss I’m seeing. I’m down 7 pounds in 6 days. 
My doc told me to take omeprazole to help with the acid so I did and that has helped. I just need to get past the diarrhea. I feel like I can’t even go to the store at this point. If you have no side effects you are so lucky! Good luck to you all. ??"

Much of my weight loss has been due to my bipolar medications. Seroquel especially makes me wake up ravenous for food.

My first month I was on the 2.5mg and I lost 20lbs. I did start exercising and eating way healthier which I think helped boost the weight loss. The only side effects  I’ve had have been: nausea from going so long without eating, brain fog, and some acid reflux. I love this medication and how it just eliminated my cravings! I have no desire to even eat junk which has helped me try healthier foods. Friedfoods now disgust me and I am naturally craving more vegetables and fiber. I was hoping the same would be true during my second month going up to 5mg but two weeks in and my appetite is returning. I’ve managed to ignore the sweet cravings but they definitely came back as well. I’m hoping my 3rd week goes better. I haven’t lost a single pound in my second month."

prevent muscle loss.  Highly recommend!"

My body craves nutritious foods and smaller portions now. I can’t even imagine eating 2 slices of pizza which is something Iwould easily do before.

Since I started Mounjaro I've lost 12 lbs in 3 1/2 weeks and I am thrilled! I've had zero side effects. It really does curb your appetite.

The only side effect I experienced was a mild headache the first day and a half which went away on it's own.
The very first day of usage I saw a significant drop in blood glucose and my numbers continued getting better throughout the week.
I suffer from ""dawn phenomenon syndrome"" which means my sugar is usually quite high in the mornings  when I wake up. Typically I'm high 200's. After starting Mounjaro I'm now down to about 140 average.
The medicine is a MAJOR appetite suppressant and it doesn't suppress by making you sick to your stomach. You simply do not desire or crave anything and you never feel hungry. The bad part of this is you have to remind yourself to eat and sometimes I have to force myself even tho I don't feel like I want or need anything. Same thing goes for liquids. You can easily get dehydrated so be sure to drink water regularly.
I have lost 7lbs in my first week (some of that is water loss of course).
I'm very excited to continue with this medicine and see what my numbers and weight look like after 30 days."

I was prescribed the 2.5 injection which is the lowest dose you can start with. I haven't seen any weight loss yet :( when I usually wake up in the mornings I'm usually starving.but this actually controls your hunger which it great!

I had a headache for approx 36 hrs and have also changed my dosage time to the morning instead of the evening due to the insomnia effects. Changing the timing has helped.  One major concern is a very dry sore throat which appeared 24 hrs after initial dose. I am monitoring and may have to halt the medication if this side effect doesn't subside."

Now I use 1.2 mg ( my max dose- I guess) still no appetite, still a bit nauseous and no special diet or exercises( except of work as a nurse at the hospital ).For constipation (which has always been my problem) I take prunes and raw fruits, tisaines.
My BMI was 31,5( 20 kg - overweight).My weight goal is 60 kg . Then I plan to stop and continue reduced calorie diet( I learned to eat now much less-about 1/3 of my previous ratio, but I eat everything as before).Now pain in knees and feet, stress incontinence , stomach discomfort (GERD), bloating, gas - all these decreased due to this treatment. I' m quite satisfied, as before nothing worked : tried some diets and exercising which was too hard on my legs , back and stomach.
Glad,I have now this weight - management tool."

Started with .06 mg and increased .06 mg each week until the max dose of 3.0 mg was reached and ultimately completed on 1/15/24. This drug and any accompanying side effects were USELESS. It did NOT decrease my appetite. In fact, I believe it INCREASED my appetite. I exercised and I made healthy food choices at least 90% of the entire time I was on the drug. ZERO weight loss. I either maintained the initial starting weight orgained a few pounds. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. I informed my physician this drug didn't work for me back in 2021, but she insisted I try it again.

I simply couldn’t eat. 
So I started back weight training and realised my training meant nothing without proper nutrition.
I also concluded that the willpower to eat correctly and go to the gym consistently was way less than the willpower to continue feeling awful every day.
So back to training 5 times a week and eating regularly and properly, keeping the diet clean and feeling a lot better.
In a weird way it helped by making me compare the two options and I have to say that the gym and nutrition option is by far superior."

I experienced side effects from the start.
Yes it curbs your appetite, but one small 
meal every couple days, that's not healthy.  I found even drinking water was an effort.  The constipation was the worst that I have ever experienced. 
I needed to get a chemist enema product to unblock the brick that was lodged in my colon! 
The non empyting of the stomach  leads to nauseating burping of rotten egg gas, and unstoppable diarrhoea, so much so I needed to wear panty liners.
The last two doses coinciding with a weekend, left me bed bound and miserable.
I understand the premise of this medication, but if vomiting is the only way to get relief from the food sitting (fermenting) in your stomach and I'm talking about light food like watermelon 3 days later and it makes you so sick, then this drug isn't for me."

I get very hot during the night, headaches, lethargic and alot of nausea but for me its worth it for the weight loss (after baby num 3 and hitting 40 next year) my portion sizes have halved as I physically feel full after a small dinner.

I have stopped increasing the dose at 1.8mg as it's working fine and I've lost 6kg in a month.

I have had some mild side effects but the good thing this both of these encourage healthy behaviours.

1) Nausea means you eat less
2) Dry Mouth means you drink more water

3) Also Harder stools, but not constipated.

Final note is that please don't binge drink on this unless you want to vomit (either on the night or the morning after). I'd suggest you skip the day's dose if you plan on this."

I have no sugar cravings, even tho they were bad before, as i am in menopause. I am so grateful for this drug. It really is a gift ! Just needs to be easily accessible on the NHS. This could help so many people today, not having to wait 2 years on the NHS Waiting list. It gives people a chance to save their lives and make positive changes to their eating habits.

I’m starting on week 3 now with the 1.8 dose and I don’t think I will progress past that amount.  The medicine has completely taken away all food cravings, which has always been my biggest struggle.  I don’t feel hungry and usually have to make myself eat.  I’ve been doing a light snack in the morning and eating whatever I want for dinner.  I eat about 1/3 of what I used to in one sitting, which has been great.  If I eat anymore than that, I find thatI feel uncomfortably full and nauseous so this forces portion control on you.  I’m down 6 lbs in 2 weeks.  Started at 170 and this morning I weighed in at 164 so that was very exciting for me to see.  Regarding side effects, they have been minimal and manageable.  I have had dizzy spells and some nausea.  I am very pleased with the experience so far.  The fact that I don’t feel hungry and the mental block to food cravings has been the biggest help."

I have always had problems with my weight and over eating. I've successfully lost weight time and time again never to maintain it for more than 12 months. 

This is the heaviest I've ever been & I just feel so ashamed every day. I've stopped socialising and I feel like I am missing so much life. I'm 5'3 and my starting weight is 106kg (233lbs) I was 110kg and lost 4 kilos by myself before starting the meds and I've lost 3kg (6.6lbs) in the first two weeks on Saxenda. . I started on the 0.6 dose the first week and went up to 1.2 the second week. I went back down to the 0.2 dose at the start of my third week as I found the fatigue too much to handle with the higher dose. I also found that I just wasn't eating enough at that dose and was dizzy, really cranky and just felt awful in general. 

I've had a little bit of nausea nothing major and it has slowed down my bowel movements where I may have to try and figure something out to get back to having a proper bowel movement each day. 

The biggest thing I have noticed is I am not snacking at all. The food chatter in my brain that has always been there has slowed down so much. I still think about food but have no desire to snack and even if I wanted to I physically can't eat it as I feel so full. My portion sizes are now at a proper size and I feel like a normal person that can manage my eating which is just a huge thing for someone that has felt so ashamed her whole life. I hope that I can continue on the lower dose for a while I don't really want to go back up again. 

I paid $387 AUD and I haven't finished my first pen yet so I think it may work out less expensive that I initially thought it would be at that price per month, especially if I can stay on the lower dose. The injections do not hurt at all but I do have yellow bruises on some of the injection sites. If you are on the fence about starting and the cost I would say its worth investing in yourself! I hope that this medication may be subsidised in the future for people who can not afford it, I feel very lucky that I was able to pay for it.

I will update again at the 3 month mark as I loved reading all of the reviews when I was looking into it."

So I’ve gone back to 0.6mg as it was working for me. I may try to up it again for week 3. But I’ll need to make sure I eat as I think the one meal a day probably didn’t help with the nausea.

Taking the medicine on the 1st day I felt underwhelmed as I had no immediate signs of the medication working, in fact I ate my dinner as normal and wanted more. I thought I would be one of those people that this medication didn’t work for. Im now on week 3 and lost 11lbs, I’m so happy with it. Im not following the incremental increases. I’ve only upped the medication to 1.2mg and will only up it again when I think my body needs it. I always eat at every meal time which I think has prevented sickness, I have a banana for breakfast, something very light for lunch 200cals and then a smaller portion of dinner, whatever the family are having.

Could have lost extra weight if i had kept up with excercises over the past month but due to family issues I had faulted slightly. 

It's expensive but I highly recommend it for anyone who is motivated for self improvement. Also recommend dry brushing, skin oils and collagen because weight loss is rapid.... keep that skin healthy so it snaps back!"

I was a bit ill and couldn't do my exercise as I used to and still lost this huge amount. 12k a day walking is helping but I think some sport will shed the pounds even quicker. Feeling much happier and relaxed with less to carry around. BMIwent down to 30 and I have much more energy. Injections are easy and when you buy the first set, you get lots of information, which is very helpful too.?
Felt some nausea but manageable, actually very helpful to not overeat. Your body will tell you what you need and when to stop eating. Haven't had any other side effects but stopped at 1.8 ml injections as this helps enormously, don't think I have to increase the dosage.

It doesn’t control cravings at all but it does make you very tired. I am a compulsive eater, which means feeling full is not something that will stop me from eating. What my brain is telling me and how full my my stomach feels have never matched up, and this med doesn’t have any effect on that. Basically it’s useless trash.

I've gained 20 lbs back in the last year, so I'm on my second round now. Lost 7 lbs in the last month but I'm really slowing down the dosage increase to once every two or three weeks. Really believe that you have to find out what works for you and stick with it."

I started taking my injections as prescribed and in the beginning would feel tired immediately after taking it. Eventually m body got used to it and it doesn't cause the sleepiness it once did. However it continues to cause chronic constipation. This lasts for days on end followed be a flood gate opening and me living in the bathroom while my body decides that everything must go all at once via bm. Although I'm unfortunately used to these horrible side effects they can come at very inconvenient times like while in the grocery store or while at the hospital visiting someone. I started taking saxenda in mid July 2022 and it is now mid January 2023 total loss has held steady at only 15 pounds and it hasn't gone down any lower. Appetite is poor and I have to be reminded to eat because the injection killed my appetite. I wouldn't recommend this medication.

I tried Saxenda a few months ago and the side effects were horrible, I stopped using it after two weeks because of the constipation and nausea. My wedding is in two months, so about a month ago I went back to my Doctor who gave me another script for Saxenda. I was desperate, despite consistently eating clean and exercising twice a day, I didn’t lose any weight. I was not obese, I weighed about 158 pounds - which I merely found uncomfortable. I am halfway through week 4 and I’ve lost 15 pounds and I hardly have any side effects! The side effects drastically reduced after week two. I am fairly active, I make my 10k steps a day and go to the gym about 3 times a week now, and tbh - I did not exercise at all the past two weeks, during the holidays. I inject in the morning, drink plenty of water throughout the day, and then have one nutritious, balanced meal at night consisting of nutrient dense veggies and protein. :-)"

I have lost weight in the past but it is a constant mental battle which has a massive effect on my mental health. I can honestly say that at day 4, I am barely even thinking about food. So much so that I have only been eating 1 meal a day! The first2 days were bad with nausea (I have started on the recommended dose of 0.6mg) but yesterday and today I have felt absolutely fine. But I am not craving chocolate, junk, takeaway and the constant thought about food has gone. I think I am also feeling fuller quicker when I am eating or maybe I am just more mindful of what I am eating. I even went shopping earlier and the junk food/chocolate aisle didn't even phase me. There is nothing that I 'want' for. I never thought that would be possible for me and I hope it lasts as my next step was surgery.

Taken a total of 10 doses so now at 1.2mg. Had vomiting on the 2nd night due to overeating  but no other side effects so far. I've lost a total of 11lbs in 10 days. Have a very small appetite in the evening and a child sized portion is more than enough to make me feel full.
The key is not to over eat or you will vomit.
Actual injection is easy to do, very small needle and entirely painless."

Since COVID and working from home, I’ve gained over 100 pounds. In two years! 

I’m a week in on the .6 dose and I’ve lost all of my appetite. To the point where I have to force myself to eat something small just to keep from throwing up or passing out. I’ve lost 13 pounds in 7 days, which Dr says is mostly retained water. Regardless, I feel a lot less bloated and actually more energetic. I’ve had mild nausea after the shot, but if Idrink my coffee right after the shot, it goes away. When I do eat, I’m full almost instantly and have 0 cravings for anything, even beer. So far, this medication has been amazing. Make sure your Dr monitors your blood with CMPs and Thyroid functions every month. Good luck"

No appetite with bloating at first and then improved.  Increase to 1.2 and have had severe stomach cramps, fatigue and no desire to eat or do anything.  I barely eat and I do not believe that this is a good thing. I walk 2 miles a day and then ride my bike 2.4 miles a day Monday - Friday but am pushing myself to continue to do so.  I also try to eat, but very little as it makes me nauseous.  I am down 10 pounds. After reading other reviews, will drop back downto .6 as I was not hungry at that level and hope that the side effects will decrease.  Only increased to a higher dose as it was what was prescribed.  I think the key is to increase when the drug stops suppressing your appetite.  Listen to your body as this is supposed to be an aide not something you live through.

Yesterday, I had mild stomach discomfort (it was just gas).  Today, I have a very light headache and a tad constipated.  I'm going to have some Miralax when I get home, and that should take care of the constipation.  I'm definitely not hungry, and have been able to fill up on a handful of raw veggies or just a salad.  I'm drinking more water than I normally do, and I think that's helping keep the normal side effects [that people have mentioned] at bay.  Given that I started the day after Halloween and we have copious amounts of candy (and I normally have a huge sweet tooth), I haven't craved or wanted even one piece.  I'm excited to see the results of this.  I've seen a variety of pounds lost per week from several people, and I should be down to my goal weight by 1/18/23 at the fastest rate or 2/15/22 at the slowest.

Unfortunately there has been no in-between but as long as I keep my meals light then I am fine. Definitely looking forward to more progress in the weeks to come.

I should have weighed myself when I started, but I did not weigh myself the first week.  Since the beginning of week 2, I have lost 8 lbs.  I have no side effects.  I do not specifically exercise, but my evening activities often include walking, lifting and carrying heavy items.  I have not been following a specific diet but have been noticing that I eat much less at meals because I feel fuller faster, and much less often than I did prior to Saxenda as I do not get hungry as often.  One strange thing I noticed is that pork products now make me feel wrong (I don't know how to describe the feeling, but not nauseous), so I am no longer eating pork products.  I also notice that my nighttime snacking is much less. I found it hard to give myself a shot at first, and it still makes me a little uneasy, but the good results keep me going. I am now wearing pants that have not fit in 2 years.  I also feel Saxenda is training me to eat less at meals and eat less often for the time when I no longer am taking it.  I am looking forward to losing more weight and would recommend Saxenda to most people who need to lose weight."

The 1st dose I noticed i was not as hungry that day.  Then as time went on the obvious curb in apatite was not as obvious but I began to realize my after dinner tv time eating was just habit not hunger. Last 2 weeks were long weekend at the lake and another was a birthday calibration and I gained 5 lbs in 2 weeks because I chose to eat and drink excessively. It works but you have to do your part andyou have to want to loose and be willing to make changes in food consumption to achieve your goals. It is an amazing drug if you have struggled with weight loss and really want to loose I would recommend trying Saxenda and I used WW along with it as a program to help me make healthy choices. The Saxenda helped curb my apatite and WW helped me make good food choices and account for and track what I am eating. I'm now down 38 LBS about 10% body weight  and can feel the difference. FYI I'm over 60 and have not yet started to exercise.

You start off on .6 go up by .6 milligrams every week at maximum. If you're having side effects, then continue on the current dose until those symptoms subside. If they don't subside then this medication is not for you as your body is not reacting properly. I've been on this for just under a month and I'm at the 1.8 mg. I noticed definitely that I am eating a lot less and I'm down about 8 to 10 lb or so. WhenI ate too much I did get a little bit of nausea. So I'll give you one guess what I did the next day, that's right, I ate less. If you're using this medication and you're getting black stools or can't get out of bed or anything like that... STOP TAKING IT. Listen to your body. It happens to work for me and I'm very grateful for it. I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes. I'll post another review at the 6-month mark!"

I will be honest I do not work out unless you count chasing after a one and a half year old. I'm very pleased with this product. My weight started at 283 pounds and I am now down to 246 lbs. I believe if I was to work out I would lose a lot more. And honestlyit is very easy to take even though it's a needle it's very small it's just 6 mm. It does suppress your appetite but at the same time it does not make you feel yucky at all. I have had no side effects.

For the first weeks the only real side effect he had was severe fatigue. He was napping everyday which is not like him but also no amount of naps and sleep overnight would make him feel better he was like a zombie. Then when that subsided, diarrhoea and sickness started (everyday). He was vomiting like crazy it was almost as if he had a crazy virus. I told him to stop the injections for a few days and see if the poorly feelings stopped and they did, he was back to normal. He then took another injection after 3 days and the sickness started again half way through the day. It’s such a shame because they were working so well for him and for someone with virtually no metabolism it gave him such a boost, but he’s had to stop altogether now as the constant sickness was doing him no good mentally."

The initial month or two I had diarrhea after that no symptoms. My appetite decreased. It made feel great but looking back I realize I should not have taken it so long. Would I do it again NO. It was amazing how quickly after stopping the medication thatI started over eating again."

Starting my second week so far I have lost 2 lb with little to no nausea. I found that when I did get the nausea it only lasted about 5 minutes I still had to be mindful of my eating as the hunger would hit me in the middle of the afternoon I was never a morning eater. So naturally I was doing intermittent fasting. I did find I did get Fuller quicker. We'll do another update when I up my dose.

I was very apprehensive about the needlepart but I literally couldn't believe how small it was 4mm, and I barely even felt it. Absolutely painless!!. I hope moving up doses goes this good.

I took it for one month, increasing my dose each week when I got the onset of severe diarrhea that lasted all day and night. A week later I got really bad vomiting. I called my Dr. who told me to reduce my dose for a few weeks and then increase slowly. I did that and after 2 weeks I experienced severe vomiting episodes again. I have officially stopped. While taking it I exercised and ate a healthy diet and drank plenty of water. I guess my body had an adverse reaction to it."

I weighed myself after 2 weeks and was 89kg, I was probably 92 when I started but I was nervous of weighing myself.  At the beginning of July, I am now 74kg.  I’m 48 years old, female, and have been a yo-yo dieter since my teens.  Sometimes quite slim but usually overweight.  I tried my usual route of low carb but I couldn’t get into it.  Saxenda has given me control over my eating.  I feel like myself again, I look much better, and I have energy.  I’m not starving myself at all, just eating healthily and walking more. The first couple of days I felt a little queasy and for the first 3 weeks I felt a bit constipated, but my body got used to it and now I feel great. I would like to lose a little more weight to put me in the healthy bmi range.  The weight loss has slowed down but I’m still losing a kilo a week on average  which is perfect.  I’m very happy with this, I would then like to move to a lower dose or something else to help me keep at my ideal weight."

The side effects are only a dry mouth and a metallic taste, but to get rid of them I drink a lot of water, which is nice. I started with a weight of 213lbs and in a week it is already 208lbs.

Started at 0.6 dose and have increased 0.6 each week with minimal to no side effects.  This drug works miraculously for me.  I had a voracious appetite before taking it and now I basically have to force myself to eat.  Not counting calories per se but this goes great with my intermittent fasting plan.  I guess range from 800 to 1200 calories a day.  Drinking water and taking a fiber supplement staves off constipation.  So far so good onthis drug and hopefully when I stop taking it I can keep the weight off.  Hoping to get down to 180 in 5-6 months.  Patience will pay off.  I highly recommend Saxenda to obese people that are pre-diabetic like me.

I eat a whole cucumber for breakfast , an apple and banana for lunch and a normal meal in the evening ( do not have large portions especially potatoes but as much greens as you want ).

I have only been on Saxenda a week and from day one I started straight back on my low carb diet, it really helps cravings for junk food. I was a bit nauseous and dizzy but started taking additional electrolytes which really help.

Week two after consultation with my doctor I increased to 1.2. Now with a strick intermittent fasting routine (no food between 8pm and 12pm. Lunch with carbs/afternoon apple/all protein dinner) I've dropped 6 pounds. I find that my lunch is all the food I can eat and struggle to eat a small dinner. I'm FULL after lunch. No side affects other than a slight nausea for about 15 minutes after injection but I think that's more low bloodsugar because of no food. 1.2 is perfect for me and the more weight I lose the more active I can be. Right now just walking but it's working for me.

I began the injection a little over a month ago, moving from .6 to 1.2 mls over two weeks. At first I thought things were great as I lost almost ten pounds during that time. As soon as I went to 1.8 things began to go downhill as nausea began and I had very little appetite. When I went to 2.4 I could barely eat anything I was so nauseated 24/7. I wanted my appetite to lessen but not like that. In one 24 hour period it was sobad I had nothing to eat. Even trying to eat a piece of biscuit I’d spit it out as soon as I began to chew. In addition, over the last two weeks since increasing to 2.4, unbelievable constipation occurred. The most bizarre thing is that over these last two weeks when I’ve barely eaten enough to keep a bird alive I have not lost a single ounce…not one!! It makes no sense. After the misery of several days at 2.4 I backed off to 1.8 but still was horribly nauseated. I’m now trying again at 1.2 just to see if I can tolerate it at that level. With my out of pocket being over $1,400.00 for this first 45 days and the negative side effects, I won’t refill. I will say however, my sugar cravings are non-existent. I don’t know if it’s because I’m already so sick to my stomach that I can’t tolerate anything, including chocolate which is one of my downfalls, or if the drug would have removed those cravings anyway had I not been nauseated. Disappointed over cost and side effects."

I started on Saxenda after consultations with my family doctor who referred me to a weight loss management doctor. I have been able to reduce blood pressure meds once so far and I'm hoping for another reduction shortly. I have NEVER felt as good as I do right now. I am on a low carb diet and only eat between an 8 hour window each day. I have had no side effects (except some very occasional upper stomach pain). I used to be bloated all the time before (and gassy), I am never bloated or gassy any more. I sometimes get leg cramps at night (but I know that's because I didn't drink enough - not because of the Saxenda). My doctor told me to take Magnesium Bisglycinate because I was having constipation. I added one 200 mg capsule daily until the issue resolved (she said I could take up to 7 daily if needed, but I settled at 4). I have a pretty sedentary job and work from home, so I haven't added in a lot of exercise. I feel like my concentration is better, my appetite is under control (for the first time ever), I'm sleeping really well, and overall I have no complaints. However, as I mentioned, my big concern was would I gain everything back again once I reach a weight I'm happy with. My doctor said that I will likely need to stay on Saxenda for up to 2 years, once I finish losing weight. She said my body is going to want to put the weight back on again and it can take up to 2 years for my brain to completely reset to my new weight. She also said I'll have to keep weighing myself regularly, and if I notice 3-5 lbs of regained weight, I'll simply go on the reduced carb diet again for a week or two. I am encouraged not just by my great weight loss so far (50 lbs in 4 months with 3 weeks not dieting), but also by a plan to help ensure I never regain this weight again. Thank you Saxenda! Thank you to my doctors!"

Hunger has been reduced and Iâ??ve started a daily routine. I recently got diagnosed with type-2 diabetes, so before going on insulin, this treatmeant should help. In reality, the root cause of this is sedentary behaviour and bad food choices over many years. This is a tool to help.  Drugs can only mask the symptoms, itâ??s up to me to change."

The treatment is supposed to help you choose the fruit over the chocolate, not make you stop eating. if you stop eating, as many do, after a while you hunger hormones in your body will reach a level where the effects of the treatment won't be able to overcome your body need for nutrients and the instinct so seek food for survival. Also your metabolic rate will slow down and you will burn less calories. the medicine doesn't stop working its just your body having had enough of you not feeding it and releasing large quantities of hunger hormones. so make sure you take advantage of the treatment and start making the right choices, the treatment should help with that, while having an appropriate amount of protein, nutrients and calories in your diet. if in doubts take your ideal weight in pounds and multiply by 12. that's the amount of calories you should be aiming for and not a ridiculous low amount of calories that is just not sustainable and your body just won't allow you to carry on. your body has its own mechanisms from stopping you doing that and that is how it supposed to be. if you dropped a large amount of weight in a small period of time be ready for it, the hunger will follow, make no mistake"

I do try to take advantage of this and fast for one day a week. I am able to eat more tho, even get slightly hungry, but still able to control how much i eat. Which is basically once or twice a day and not more than a handful of food each time. You must limit how much you eat if you want to lose wt!! Im at 2.4 dose and have not yet taken the 3.0. i actually stayed at the dosage until i felt good enough to up the dose. which is not how the instructions say but as you know, it can make you feel pretty sick. I am hoping to start loosing wt again, more at a consistent rate. Will probably start some wt training to see if it helps lose more wt. Maybe my body lost too much too quick and needs to catch up?? who knows?  If this happened to you, what did you do to restart losing wt??

I worked up to full dosage as directed. Symptoms were a little nausea at first, but it went away within a month or two. It worked great at first, I wasn't hungry in the least and would forget to eat. I've lost 25 pounds but the last few weeks have gained back 3. The loss was slow. I feel at this point my body is used to Saxenda. I've discovered I eat b/c I'm bored or just because I think it's time (like lunch at noon, etc) not because I'm actually hungry. I think it's still helping with hunger some, but because I keep eating when I'm not hungry I'm gaining some back. This has me very concerned as to whether or not I'll be able to keep the weight off. My insurance has me pay $30/month and with the rebate card you get from drug maker they take $5 off so my monthly cost is $25 at Walmart. I believe my insurance will only pay for 1 year, so I'm on a time limit. I find I'm feeling bad about myself for eating when I'm not hungry. My old eating habits have crept back in, snacking on candy/chocolate/ice cream and larger than needed portions and I'm sure that's to blame for the weight gain. I might mention I'm female with life long weight issues of being 20-40 pounds overweight most of my adult life. I'm 49, I work from home, am sedentary and I'm now entering menopause (yay me - not- the hot flashes suck!) Another side note however I'm not sure it's directly related to Saxenda is that my blood pressure went through the roof after being on it for 5 months. I couldn't find any info that said that was a symptom. But after losing the initial 20 pounds I'm now on BP meds. My Dr. says she thinks it's birth control pill related combine with my age. I'm off BC and still on BP meds. I am curious to know if anyone else had issues with BP with this drug. I've never had BP issues until now. Maybe it's just time? Hopefully this helps future users."

I have lost 17 pounds and was doing fine until two weeks ago. I started feeling nauseated most of the time. Then I started burping what seems like an egg taste/smell. After that came vomiting. I was at 2.4 so I cut back to 1.8. That worked well for about two weeks so I increased it. The same series of events occurred - twice, two days apart. It's almost like if I eat anything, later that day or night, I am going to be sick. The stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea sent me to the ER yesterday where they did an ultra sound and CT scan looking for gall bladder problems, etc.  I have a doctor's appointment later today and will see what he says. I know I can't continue with these side effects but hate to give up with the medicine working."

I am a bit worried that this could be my last hope and it may not work for me.  So many people say they loose their appetite and have to force themselves to eat, still waiting for this ""full feeling"".  Could it be that I am a vegan and already eat low fat and few calories, thats why I have no symptoms?  I am the enigma that no one can figure out, I count calories1000 - 1400 cal/day, eat whole foods, never fast food and my blood work looks good.  I look at food and gain weight.  I am the only "" healthy fat vegan"".  I really need this to work, I can only hope that I will progress and lose weight as I increase my dose. FINGERS CROSSED"

It did curve my appetite.  I got really concerned when I reached 3.0 cause I started having stomach pains and severe constipation.  I told my dr. about it but all should could say is reduce the dosage and drink plenty of fluids.  I did and I didn't get better until I took the dosage back to 1.2. I was also concerned with the size affects that was of this drug.  Thyroid cancer and heart problems and stomach problems. I am gradually weaning myself off this drug.I haven't lost weight for3 months so to me I don't need to be on something that cost and to be honest I have to do this on my own anyway.  All the medicine does is curve the appetite. It's not worth me having thyroid cancer or other side affects down the road.

Now not losing and maybe it's because I can't increase without side-affects.   Not everyone reacts the same.  I will say that I still do not have the cravings for sugar that I had prior to beginning the program.  So that's good news.  I ride a recumbent bike and lift light weights about 4-6 times a week.  Sometimes walk my dog for about 1/2 mile during the week too, but exercise is not new to me - always exercise.  I plan to attempt increase again hoping side effects go away.

Last year, I was referred to a doctor that specializes in this disease; at the time I first met him, I weighed a whopping 387 pounds (I’m 5’10’’). Of course, the first thing he told me was that my POS would get better if I lost weight. I was totally discouraged! I told him that I was very active and had been on EVERY diet… nothing seemed to work. I was so frustrated and asked if there was anything he could do to jump start my weight loss from a medical stand point. This is when he told me about Victoza and about the study that demonstrated that individuals suffering from POS, not from Type 2 diabetes had lost weight on this medication but there were some serious side effects to consider. I was so desperate that after reading on the matter for a few days, I decided to try it out. The first months were pretty horrible because I had severe nausea and vomiting (in the morning upon waking I would throw up stomach acid – I know erk!) but I decided to continue. The reason I kept up with it is that, for the first time in my life, I could sense that I was full when I ate. For some reason, this message was not making its way up to my brain when I ate before… I thought it was awesome. The medication no only killed every craving I normally had but it stopped me from overeating. I have been on Victoza for one year now. The side effects are no longer there (they stopped after about 6 months after starting Victoza) and I now weigh 276 pounds… yes I lost over 100 pounds. I am continuing to lose weight and wish you all the best."

I heard some great things about victoza and some really bad things so I decided to try it out and hope for the best. Sad to say that I simply couldn't stand all the side effects that I encountered while on it. I felt like I was in a daze all the time and the nausea was really bad. I completely lost my appetite and after a week I started to throw up multiple times a day. I decided to stop because it simply made me sick to my stomach. I did some research on the internet to try and find something over the counter without side effects. I found this supplement called cinnalife which so far has been amazing for me. My A1C has significantly dropped which i'm sure is a large part due to the energy that this supplement gives me. I have been very active since I started taking them. Anyways, just wanted to share that there are always alternatives to these injectables with these horrible side effects. I have heard that there are some new injectables out in the market, but I'm simply too scared to try them =("

I have had some intermittent nausea but it's mild and tolerable. Only other side offect was a mild headache and my fasting blood sugar was 77 this morning.  77!  I am also on Invokana and Glipizide and without the Victoza my sugars were in the 180s-200s fasting.  Also, for those dreading the needle, it is tiny.  I felt only one of the three needle sticks so far and the one I did feel was much less painful than sticking my finger to check my blood sugar, which I do multiple times a day.  Don't let fear of an injection keep you from considering this medication as an option.  I will update once I have been on Victoza for a longer time."

I went back on Victoza and both the diarrhea and breathing problems came back so I can no longer take it.  I would become out of breath just walking from the parking lot into a store.  I was also tired a lot as I was not getting enough oxygen.  Now my energy level has also gotten better.  I was really disappointed as my A1c was lowered while I was takeing Victoza.

After my gallbladder removal I remained sick with the same symptoms I had prior to it of: heartburn, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, severe foul smelling belching, and gas. This continued for some time, and my doctor decided to remove me off my Victoza because my diabetes #'s, and A1C were getting to a level of satisfaction for her.     I remained off my Victoza for about a month, and my blood sugar numbers began to gradually creep up again, so my doctor decided to put me back on it.     I had finally became free of the side effects listed above, but still not relating them to the Victoza.  Then my wife, who is a RN said the she was getting ready to give me a Victoza injection, and wanted me to let her know if any of the symptoms that I'd had for so long returned.  Within 30 mins of receiving the Victoza injection I again started having foul smelling belching, gas, and began vomiting profusely.      Victoza is an awesome drug, and does what it's suppose to do.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is able to take it, but if you have anything weird start happening within your body once you start taking it, you can bet money that the Victoza Will be what's causing it."

The third week I started getting heartburn which continued into the 4th week.  I'm waiting to see the doctor to see if this is a typical side effect and how long it lasts.  I would hate to give it up as it has  lowered my after meal blood sugar by at least 30.  Has anyone else had this problem?"

I am also taking insulin.  However, my nausea turned quickly to vomiting and dizziness.  I continued in the hope these symptoms would go away.  I was certainly losing weight but at great cost.  Finally, I was so weak I had to be rushed to the emergency room.  I was severely dehydrated and my blood pressure was so low the doctor there put me on intravenous fluids. AS soon as I stopped the Victoza I began to feel better and am now feeling pretty ok.  Dizziness, dehydration and extreme low blood pressure went away. Just as well, because right before all this, I had gone to the drug store to fill my prescription for Victoza (till then my doctor had given me samples) and I found out it was going to cost $600 to fill!  Needless to say, I can´t afford this.  I live on social security and a small pension."

The nausea went away in a few weeks. I took the shot in the evening so wasn't nauseous all day, just in the morning. Needles are so small they hardly hurt at all. It decreased my appetite & I was able to lose 20 lbs. Still plagued with the diareha, but don't know if that is the victoza or the gallbladder surgery I had in July. My A1C went from 8.6 to 6.5. Was happy with this med. But now insurance won't cover it in 2014, so I have to try something new."

When I made the Jump to 1.2, no nausea but a slight bit of back pain again. After a day at 1.2, all was fine. Very quickly, my BG wne from 205 down to 150, and now at 135 and still going down, I also take the generic Actos as well as a Metformin. The Actos is in the AM and at the smallest dose. Three 500mg Metformin (1 in the morning-2 at bedtime) complete the regiment. Victoza, for me has been simple and painless. It's been effective and time will tell if there are adverse effects. I can only recommend that you see a really good endocrinologist. Get ALL your blood levels, A1C checked, and follow a better diet. I'm really bad about this but, I'm trying hard to be better. Also, stay away from all sodas, and drink V8 juice in moderation. Use Tabasco to give it some zing. Love yourself and life too!"

Prior to this drug, I wason Januvia, novolog, and metformin. Kept only the metformin (1000mg 2x day) and added this Victoza. I know this isn't the perfect drug with the side effects, but it is an answer for me.    Major tip: eat small...and I mean small...meals throughout the day. Drink slowly in between the meals. The only time I have vomited was on the second day when I ate a bowl of soup and then drank three cups of tea right away....I won't do that again!!  And don't even attempt a six inch subway sub in one sitting. I won't do that again either. I swear this drug is like a lap-band you inject! :))))"

Nice not to have to take but once a day.  Taking 1000 Metformin twice a day as well.  Lost 10 pounds after starting Victoza, just as I did for Byetta (but lost 30 then).  Took Victoza for 13 months. Quit because my husband and friends said my mouth smelled like a sewer; I had thought it was just me tasting it, but they could smell it as well.  I was belching a lot, flatulence as well.  But that taste was what drove me back to Byetta.Weight loss stops pretty fast; I think it is a side effect of the nausea making you not eat, not the drug doing something swell.  Lots of itching in the last 6 months of taking it.  Didn't change my morning blood sugar levels any better than Byetta or just Metformin, which were 120 and doc wanted below 100.  Turns out morning high due to predawn low while sleeping, causing the sugar to swing high.  This is a known phenomena; if it's just your morning sugars high, consider that. Victoza good for 3-4 months, then just like other meds.  Expensive.  Insurance company gave me hell continually about finding an alternative. Beware the sewer mouth.

Tried all sorts of medications and this one has been the easiest and best so far.  Concerned about the thyroid cancer, but will be vigilant.  Did not like needles, but I do it on the side of my stomach and can not even feel it, unlike the finger testing.  I have also recently lost my gall bladder and have developed a candida yeast infection which has also messed up my stomach.  I was on massive amounts of anti biotics and am not sure if victoza played a role in that or not.  Trying to get my stomach balanced.  Have lost 25 pounds, but that was as much contributed to almost dying from the gall bladder and not being able to eat for two months.  Blood sugars and A1c have been GREAT since starting this.  I also take metformin (1000mg's) twice a day.  Have had to go on and off metformin due to some of the testing and the surgeries I have had, which seems to increase numbers.  Together, victoza and metformin seem to work very, very well even without major improvements in my diet.  Dont give up on the victoza/metformin.  Try tweaking things a bit until you feel better.  Good luck!"

My blood sugar was nearly perfect and I lost 40 lbs in 4 months.  Then.....    All of the appetite suppression went away, and of course my weight started going up and up.   I have now gained back the 40 pounds plus 10 more!   I'm very disappointed.   My doctor doesn't have an explanation.    I did notice that one time when I accidently double dosed myself (several hours apart) that the appetite control came back, at least for a few hours.    I just don't see a lot of difference between taking two 1000mg of Glumetza, and taking the Glumetza plus the Victoza.    This is all based on my personal experience.      I think in August I'm going to go back on Byetta for a while."

I would inject it every morning at 6:00 A.M. ant take my hypertension meds (by mouth with food) at the same time.  As I titrated the dose up to 1.8mg.'s my blood pressure began going up.  By time I reached the 1.8 mg. dose my BP had reached a really dangerous level (174/108 so I stopped taking it and my BP dropped back to it's normal(118/76) or reasonably there about.  Needless to say, my physician wasn't happy that I had discontinued theVictoza with out consulting him.  He went as far as to say ""the Victoza wouldn't do that""(time for a new Doc.) referring to the elevated BP.  Long story short..the doc. changed my BP meds and placed me back on the Victoza...Same problem with the BP again.  Not wanting to stop the Victoza because it was really controlling my blood sugar readings and food cravings, I did some more research decided to try taking the Victoza 3 hours after my BP meds....Bingo..BP has stayed within my normal range and the Victoza is working well.  My guess is that the Victoza works so well at slowing stomach emptying that the my BP meds were probably only trickling into my system if they were being absorbed at all.  Only other problem was some constipation...that seems to have passed (sorry for the bad pun)."

I recently found that not only had I gained weight but my insulin use increased substantially (daily fast acting up to 70 units; evening insulin up at 62 units).  I began using Victoza about 1 month ago and the results have been startling.  There was a 2 1/2 day period that other than the Victoza shot, I took NO insulin whatsoever!  While using VictozaI soon learned that any corrective fast acting insulin must be reduced dramatically or there are severe ""going low"" consequences.  No problem now with adjustments I've made (I take no more than 7 units of fast acting insulin for a full  day and I reduced my evening type dose to 42 units.)  Now when I awake in the morning, my blood sugars are between 80-133 and are relatively normal throughout the day.  A huge change for me.  I have also lost 15 lbs. and have a suppressed appetite (something that goes along with the Victoza use).  The side effect for me is nausea.  This side effect began on day 1 and continued for almost 20 hours/day for a month.  Now my nausea has been significantly reduced but my appetite remains suppressed.  This is a miracle drug!  My doctor says this drug contains a certain hormone (nomally produced by the body) that directs the pancreas to produce more insulin (the stated purpose of Victoza). Apparently, I have not been making this hormone for some time.  Now, 1 Victoza shot of 1.2 units/day is all it takes and I'm close to normal. I hope this all continues."

My only issues are the cost which I currently have a 1 yr. discount card from Victoza for $25/mo. and the belching/constipation. Just uncomfortable but not horrible. I went off oral meds because of gastro issues (allergic to sulfa) and had been on Byetta (didn't work) and Symlin (unpredictable nausea) as well as lantus and novloog. Am now off novolog entirely and dosage on lantus is cut by about 1/3.

Started on 0.6 and moved up to 1.2 two weeks later. Initial nausea has subsided. My sugar levels are way down, I am losing weight and have stopped my nightly insulin injections. Still take 2000 mg of metformin daily. After all the other drugs I have been on, this is the only one that has worked and I am quite happy with it."

Instant positive results with Victoza.  Initially, I had nausea, but that improved on a daily basis.  I'm not constantly hungry, so I can see weight loss in my future.  I will be increasing the dose to 1.2 mg within the next week, and remain optimistic that I can deal with any side effects that might accompany the increased dose.  Victoza has been an eye opener for me.  2 or 3 days of use showed me that being more and more restrictive in my diet was not going to help my oral meds lower my blood sugar.  I am just so happy with the results I've experienced so far with Victoza.  I feel like the hands of time have been turned back for my health!!!!"

I am so happy with the weight lost. I started out on lowest dose, I am on max dose now. I did have nausea mostly at night and some acid reflux. It seems to be getting alot better. My glucose readings are way down. The lowest it's been in 13 years.I can't wait to go back to dr at the end of month to see what my A1C is now. Last one was 7.3.... I take Janumet 50/1000mg 2xday. Amaryl 4mg-- 1and half tab daily.Victoza 1.8mgin morning. It definitely decreased my appetite, I no longer crave sweets like I used to, which is amazing in itself.....This is a wonder drug for me, I just hope I dont end up with the thyroid cancer. My pharmacist said it is safe, that the benefits outweigh the risk and that everything has potential for serious side effects. I dont know if losing the weight has anything to do with this but I noticed my blood pressure has been really low so I decreased my benicar to see if that's what I needed... I hopefully will loose some more weight at least 20lbs and I would be so happy...... I will post my blood results when I get them next."

I did experience nausea with initial dosing, however, Dr. prescribed Phenergan to take along with the shot until the nausea subsided.  The Dr. recommended taking the shot just before bedtime along with the anti-nausea meds.  Also, do not give the initial dosages in your stomach area, this will increase the nausea effects.  My A1c went from 7 to 5.1.  I have lost about 45 lbs. and will probably no longer have to take Metformin.

Still having nausea despite watching dietary intake, drinking fluids, etc.  Fasting BS have been between 85-110 and after meals highest was 115.  However I can't stand the nausea and have experienced dizzyiness, weakness and constant leg and foot aches and pains (not sure what this is all about as I have done nothing to hurt my legs/feet).  Also been having itching scalp, legs , arms and body but thought it was just dry skin.  Didn't know it was a side effect until today.  I've tried giving injections with meals, without meals and at bedtime.  I wake up nauseated and experience nausea throughout the day even on lowest dose.  I don't think this drug is for me.

Using  Actos pills, Lantus at 45 units daily and Humalog 10 – 15 units 3X daily. A1C was 6.5 and gaining one pound per month.  Initial goal was to lose weight. First attempt 0.6 for one week then 1.2. Stopped because of the vomiting and hiccups.  Second attempt 0.6 for one month then 1.2. At 1.2 suffered from heartburn, ED and hiccups. Third attempt 0.6 until sugar levels begin to rise (2 Months) then went to 1.2 for two weeks. At full dose for just over a weeknow. No longer taking Lantus or Humalog with morning readings between 100 and 106. Spikes are below 180 two hours after meals and 100 – 106 before meals.  Side effects are hiccups after meals and random hiccups between meals, constipation and ED. ED medications ineffective so far.  Giving it another month to see if the ED goes away. The key was staying at a lower dose until blood sugars rose to the point of increasing insulin. Eating several small meals daily and drinking lots of water with mild exercise is a plus."

Started off at 0.6 for 1 week... then increased by two CLICKs each day for 5 days until I reached the goal of 1.2mg. I found that the slow titration upward decreased the side effects. I must say I've had some nausea the first week... but haven't vomited until today. Vomited several times this morning... not sure why now?? Injections in my stomach and thigh often times causes a quarter size bruise. I don't like that at all. I have found a hip injection to work the best... no pain or bruising. I hope that site is ok. It seems to be working pretty well. BSs are down a good bit but my fasting bs is higher than I would like... about 115 each morning. I hope my A1C gets back below 7 and I don't have to increase my dose up to 1.8. Constipation is my biggest side effect. I have never had that issue before. I'm taking 3 Docusate Sod 100mg per day. Its better but still an issue. So far, I like the Victoza over Metformin as the Metformin made me violently sick with nausea/vomiting/diarrhea.  So overall I'm pleased... will know more later"

I cannot stand the morning nausea feeling anymore. occasionally this is accompanied by vomiting/dry heaves of thick clear foamy liquid.  Victoza has decreased my appetite. I do not know how much if any weight loss yet.It has lowered by morning sugars to the 90's.  I would like to continue to take it for its appetite depressant and lower blood sugars but I cannot stand the nausea ruining days out of my life.  I have changed the timing of the medication, which seemed to help for a while, but I am still getting the nausea.  I do crave sweets more though.  I would only hope that there is a solution to my problem because I do want to continue this medication for its sugar lowering and weight loss effects but will not be able to do so with this nausea.

Lost 10 pounds and sugars were never over 120. Root cause was Meals to large and not drinking enough water. Second attempt experienced ED at 1.8. Third attempt, first week, 0.6; sugars no higher than 125, have not taken any Lantus or Humalog. Lost 4 pounds.  mild heart burn and occasional hiccups.  Will move up click by click until ED occurs then back off until ED goes away. Third time Pros; weigh loss, not hungry and lower sugars. Cons; not thirsty, can’t judge sugar low levels by feel, not thirsty at all, very small and more frequent meals or violent hiccups/nausea will result, generally feel different, mild heart burn, occasional hiccups when I consume near the food limit.

Blood sugar is well controlled, usually between 90 and 110 in the morning, and during the day staying within 20 points of the morning reading--much better than with the once-a-day insulin.  Also in those three weeks I've lost 8 pounds.  Minor nausea (though no vomiting) has kept my appetite down.  Have been experimenting with much smaller meals, which has usually helped.  I am very tired, though--is this aside effect of the drug or the disease?  Very satisfied with the drug."

Told my Dr. about the vomiting; she wanted me to stay on it. So I started over with using the lower, middle and higher doses on a weekly basis.  Still I could not tolerate the violent vomiting and rotten eggs burping tastem and 'losing' 2 days of my life every time I got sick. I lost only 10 pounds. My numbers did not come down, especially the fasting. My Dr. does not know I quit taking it; she will not be happy with me but that's a chance I have to take. Went back toMetformin and Glimepiride. #s are better if I watch the carbs; if I don't, they go through the roof. It would appear I'm on my way to insulin."

My clothes are not as snug and people are noticing so I know it is working in that area.  I am still concerned about the stomach issues and may need to adjust the dose.

I have far more to go but I see motivating photo results on Reddit Zepbound pages. The Pen injections don’t hurt! But the side effects have not been easy.  1. At starting dose 2.5 mg, came diarrhea for about a month. If I ate anything oily or with corn fructose, my stomach revolted.  It modified my food behavior!  2. If I overeat, I feel nauseous and sometimes get headaches.  3.  After I went to 5mg at month 3, I was very constipated - like for 3-7 days.  I found a non-medical solution: cup of strong coffee with 3-4 spoons real sugar & fat & sugar free creamer, then 6-8 oz of prune juice.  Wait 2-3  hours, and if no results, drink a 2nd cup of prune juice.  Wait up to another 3-4 hours. Patience is a virtue!

I', feeling so much better no more being short of breathe. But.......I have suffered the side effects, burping, nausea, Injection site itching. But I noticed if you give yourself the injection in your thigh the side effects are not so bad.  and I found also, if you do the injection in the fatty part of your thighs meaning the inside if your thigh, you don't suffer the side effects.  I had to pay out of pocket of $550 a month because my insurance would not pay for it. Which is a shame. But I do know people who their insurance did cover the cost.

It seems Zepbound is better than Ozempic, people who I know who has used Ozempic had to come off it and go to the ER due to the side effects.

My cholesterol was increasing as well. My blood pressure averaged 145/93, and I was on two medications for that.

My doctor asked if I had thought about the new weight loss drugs Zepbound and Wegovy. He said that both drugs had just received FDA approval for weight loss, that both drugs were remarked/dosed versions of existing drugs to treatdiabetes, and that likely insurance would fight to cover them. He suggested Zepbound as he felt it was the better medication, and sure enough, insurance denied it. I got the cash discount from the manufacturer and had two months in savings I could spare, so I paid for the first two months out of pocket. I have never had any side effects to speak of. This was a life-changing medication. I can't state that in any other way. 

After the first month, I had lost almost 20 pounds. My cravings were no longer an issue (and they still aren't). After the second month, I lost another 20 pounds. I could return to the gym and exercise - my body no longer hurt just moving around. My doctor took me off one of my blood pressure meds as my typical blood pressure was now at 108/63. Even my plague psoriasis cleared up (this is NOT a known condition Zepbound treats, but after ten years with psoriasis, it's gone). My insurance finally covered Wegovy, which I have been on since, with a total weight loss now of 56 pounds. My A1C level is back to normal, my blood pressure continues to stabilize in the 116/69 zone, I'm off my psoriasis medication and one of my blood pressure meds. My cholesterol is back to normal. I am eating significantly better than I have in decades. I am consistently working out. Again, this medication is a life changer."

When I would get full, food immediately repulsed me.  I stopped craving junk food.  I'm at month 7 and its pretty much stopped working.  I'm not losing any weight and I'm hungry all the time.  I'm craving junk food BAD.  Waiting for my insurance to approve Wegovy again.  Hopefully they will cover it.  If your insurance denies the injection, I would recommend going on Rybelsus.  Worked great for about 6 months for me."

I suppose the holy trinity of relevant ailments.  I started on 3mg and after a few months I’m now on 14mg tablets. Although it does cause side effects, namely constipation, going for a wee more at night and some nausea, the advantages are worth it. I’ve already lost 18 lbs with a target of 50. It really does blunt appetite throughout the day and I find my portions are half the size when I eat my evening meal.I’m hoping other cardio benefits (in addition to weight loss) will further increase my life expectancy and allow me to led a fuller and more active life. I also like the fact that it reduces my alcohol in-take which is probably linked to the hunger suppressor effect it has. Two glasses of red wine and I’m done. All good."

Just from the fasting (no food from 9p-9a), not eating potatoes and minimizing my bread intake I lost 20 lbs.  In the six months since taking Rybelsus I have lost another 10 lbs.  Rybelsus does seem to help me with feeling hungry less often.  However, it has also caused me several bouts - about once a month - with cramping or constipation/diarrhea.  My tips...taking the pill is easier than an injection but not by much considering how bitter it is (and if it gets stuck in your mouth or throat for any reason you'll regret it).  I also found that I had to avoid any greasy/oily/spicy foods as those seemed to bring on the cramping/upset stomach issues much faster.  Now having my A1C much lower (due to the diet change/weight loss) I'll be stopping Rybelsus soon.  It's just not worth the impact (gastroparesis) that it is having on my digestive system, in my opinion.  It wasn't a terrible medicine most of the time, but if you do experience the side effects they can be considerable."

My A1C levels dropped.  I have lost about 32 pounds.  I have had some light headedness and nausea.  I was also taking Metformin and my doctor advised me to stop the Metformin since my concern was the light headedness.  Since stopping that, I very occasionally have some light headedness but not like I was with both Rybelsus and Metformin. Some constipation and diarrhea.  Not overly bothersome for me.  I have not noticed a metallic taste or anythinglike that.  If I feel nauseous I drink a little water or eat a little something and that helps.  I asked my doctor to keep me on the 3 mg because I tolerated it well and it did what it was supposed to do.  My appetite has decreased and I don't have the sugary cravings as often, rarely in fact.  I crave fruits more than anything on this.  I am nervous about long term effects reading all of the reviews posted.  Another reason I have asked to stay on the 3 mg.  I will see my doctor again next month to review more lab work.  This medication has been successful for me but there are a few side effects I deal with as mentioned above. Overall the medication has done what my doctor wanted it to do."

I took Rybelsus exactly as recommended, starting with 30 days of 3 mg, and worked my way upto 14 mg. I am down 32 pounds but that has been over many months. I eat less, slower, low fat and very few sweets. Letting your body digest your food and not over eat is key. And I play a lot of pickle ball. I have had no side effects, and my A1C last check was 6.

I stopped taking it and it went away. I switched to vegan and lost 72lds naturally, A1C dropped from 6.9 to 5.6 naturally and I'll never put that drug in my body again. Especially now that I discovered how to reverse type 2 diabetes with a whole food plant based diet with very little fat.

That was my no more moment. Yes I lost weight, mostly because I couldn't eat without feeling sick, yes my a1c came down, but the bad effects are not worth it. Now 2 weeks afterstopping it I am in the emergency room thinking am having heart attack and am told it's a gallbladder stone. Lucky they don't recommend surgery since it's only 1 and my gallbladder isn't inflamed or infected. 12 hours at er, excruciating pain in my chest and back with non stop vomiting. Not how I'd planned my day. At home I research and see the rybelsus can take 3 months to leave body after last pill.

I didn't know what to expect, other than my doctor telling me it was going to curb my appetite. Holy cow, he was right! I've been about 45 pounds overweight for over a year and it's been really difficult for me to lose. In seven days, I've already lost six pounds! 
There are some side effects which aren't that great, but I'm losing weight so fast, I don't even care. I'm mildly nauseous often and it's not a fun feeling, but the queasiness ismanageable. Also, I am only able to eat a fraction of a full plate before feeling very full. I can't eat another bite after only enjoying 1/4 of what I normally consume. My bowel movements have dramatically slowed down to every other day or so, but I'm eating so little now, my stomach has actually become flat. The constipation doesn't bother me very much. 
Overall, this experience, so far, has been amazing for me, even with the mild side effects. I've been trying to lose weight for years!

I moved from a 3mg to a 7mg in four days and then to the top 14mg.  I lost 23lbs after 2 months and never had any problems except extreme constipation (you just intake more fiber to counteract this). The key is little-to-NO sugar, fat and VERY LOW carbs.  You can consumer carbs but if you keep daily consumption under 15 (just like with Keto or Paleo), your weight will drop significantly, quickly!I am on a second round after seeing if I could hold my own weight without it for several months and I only gained 5 pounds.

I guess I am lucky--I have had no side effects other than constipation. I had to start taking MiraLax daily which solved this issue.  I have been on it for 5 months and have lost 24 pounds. It isn't a miracle weight loss drug.  It just curbs hunger pains and makes you feel full faster, so you eat much less.  I have also found it helps with cravings--sweets and fried foods are not as tempting. it's odd, I just don't want them much any more. I do feel better over all and walk daily now.  I do think the weight loss has plateaued for now after 5 months with eating the same small meals.  It will be interesting to see if you can continue to lose weight long-term on this med.

I had zero tolerance for anything fried, or Sulphur burpsand gas would happen (a few pieces of fried shrimp y'all, not going to happen on this drug). On 14mg - waking up in the middle of the night with stomach cramps, ending up in the bathroom projectile vomiting, started. Figured out this was 100% tied to what I ate, if not how much. You absolutely have to change your diet when taking this. Things like Caesar salad, rich pastas, subs, fried food, etc. your body will reject even if only occasional.

Stopped taking for 5 days, of which 3 days in the symptoms diminished. Day 4 and 5 felt almost normal again. Tracked blood sugar through-out the 5 days, which went from 110 to 150. On day 6, took a pill and 8 hours later, symptoms came back, but blood sugar started back down, and is 143. Note: have not lost a single ounce of weight, the entire time."

You see those stupid commercials where actors tell that ""my A1C used to be here (high) and now its here (low)."" Well, I use a CGM. Before Rubelsus my ""time on target"" was 91% and since Rybelsus, my time on target is 33%. In my case, Rybelsus seems to be working the exact opposite way of the way it is supposed to; stimulation my liver to release more glucose and inhibiting my pancreas from releasing more insulin. Why did I start taking it if my time on target was 91%? Because i was taking metformin and glimeperide together and when I would sleep my blood glucose would drop dangerously low. One time it hit 30. Several times in the 40's. Quite a few times in the 50's and 60's. So I was put on Rybelsus to keep my blood glucose down in the normal range without getting to low. Well, yes, it never gets to low any more. But that is because i am in the high caution or danger area almost all the time. Rybelsus is worthless. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone."

I have not been able to shift my weight due to not being able to move without pain. Prior to taking it I had just tried the svelte diet plan and had actually lost 2kg in the 11 days detox. I decided to keep following the food suggestions within this diet plan whilst taking wegovy.

I kept losing weight by small amounts whilst taking 0.25 and 0.5 amounts. I had a small amount of nausea and tiredness but that wasonly in the first two days of taking the injection. I've just completed my 4th injection of 1.0 and at this dosage the weight has been falling off. I have been waking up in the night with indigestion but have found sleeping on my left side eases this.  

I am no longer waking up and walking in pain, im no longer limping and feeling so much lighter. My belly has gone and i can see down there again. I've lost 12kg so far and am so thankful for wegovy in helping me shift this weight off.

The only complaint i have is the shock of finding out as the dosages go up the price goes up by a ridiculous amount! I'm in Australia and the doses from 0.25 to 1.0 were $260 per month. I filled my first script for 1.7 it has gone up to $380!!

I will be speaking with my doctor to let her know she needs to inform her patients that the costs increase with the dosages."

But uncomfortable. Headache and dizziness is a bit challenging to deal with at the moment . Despite the side effects I hope they subside because I feel some of my inflammation has gone down which has helped me into being able to stay active thru my day. I just hope the dizziness does go away because it’s a bit hard to even walk straight without thinking I’m gonna fall. Almost fells like I’m drunk ?

It tells me when I've had enough by making me feel repulsed but only when I've reached  my limit, which is a lot less than I thought it would be.  It also has taught me not to eat at bedtime or I will get stomach pains and have sulphur burps.  This all sounds horrible but it's the kick in the butt that I needed to teach me that I don't need so much food.  Had ice cream the other day, my all time favourite food, had about 4 bites and i was fine with that and gave the restaway.  Not because I was trying to have will power but because I genuinely just didn't want it.

I also work at Sonic and deliver 200 or more orders a day so that may have what helped me a little too. I started eating yogurt, nuts, and straight protein and drinking a ton of water a day!

I've gone from 184lbs to 155lbs in 19 weeks.  I'm pre-diabetic.  Dieting and exercise never worked for me.  I was miserable in my own skin.  I couldn't lose weight - even after months on a 1000-calorie /day diet. 

My side effects are minimal (occasional nausea) now.  I did have a lot of nausea to start with - but 'morning sickness' home remedies worked. 

The benefits are amazing!  I used to be so out of breath when I'd do anything strenuous - not any more.  I'm comfortable in my own skin again.  My BP is down!  I'm completely satisfied with small portions and have zero cravings. 

If this doesn't work for you - or if you have bad side effects - perhaps Wegovy isn't the right treatment for you.  

Perhaps the side effects are due to another medication you take?
After losing 20 lbs, I was lightheaded and dizzy.  It wasn't the Wegovy - it was because I no longer needed BP medication.      I stopped the BP med and immediately the dizziness was gone. 

I hope my review helps you!"

I was supposed to go to .68 13 days ago, but decided to bump up to only .60 to save money. I am getting 5+ weeks from a 3 mg vial (somehow, they put more in the vial.)  I started at 201, and quickly went to 189; then slowly to 185, and now at 182.5. After I complete 10 weeks of .60, I will bump up to the final .68.  My income will go up in 2.5 months. I paid $299 + $94 'membership fee' for 1 mg vial in month 1; then $299for a TWO mg vial + $94 fee. Now I am paying $299 + $94 fee for a WHOPPING 3 mg vial.

Even before I started compounded Wegovy, I had constant constipation. Stool softeners would only work a little bit. I switched to EXTRA strength Ex-Lax. It works, but I am addicted to it, ha ha!

I just barely qualify for the medicine. I am exactly 5' 5 1/2""  Provider rounded it down to 5'5"", and at 189 => 31% body fat. I actually used a previous provider who got me down from 201 to 189. He didn't weigh my or anything. His medicine ramp up scale was even more slow.

I was able to lose my  semi-temporary weight gain a lot more easily. I got covid 8 months ago, and ate a lot and rested on the sofa. So, the first 12 pound drop went fairly easy and fairly quickly.

Now, I've broken thru a stubborn plateau, and hope my weight loss continues.  Today 182.5; goal 155. If I have to, I can increase from .68 to 1.0 but it is expensive.  1.0 would only last me 3 weeks + a stupid $94 membership fee every mont"

I have had no side effects.  I check in with a doctor every 30 days for a check up online.  I follow exactly what she says: eat more protein drink water and eat.  When I am not hungry in the morning I go for a no sugar yogurt or an Atkins Plus protein shake.  I eat my heaviest meal at lunch now and very light dinner.  I drink lots of water.  If find Wegovy curbs my hunger and stops me from mindless eating.  I focus less on food.  I am finding it easierto stay on track and work on making better habits.  I also use the Wegovy website and have a free coach that chats with me every 2 weeks on my habits.  I think I am losing weight this time because I decided to get help from my doctor and the drug is helping me to pay attention to what I am putting in my mouth.  I will continue to take it till I reach my goals and maybe a little beyond that to wean myself off.  I have about 60 more lbs. to lose and feel I will reach my goal for the first time in 30 years (time I have been holding on to the extra weight).

These injections definitely have pros and cons. I have to take anti-nausea medication at least once a day to be able to tolerate any of the doses, and take it more frequently the couple days following my injection. I would not be able to get the injections without that. I never feel great or normal, but it is usually tolerable. I have definitely had a decreased appetite (which is theobvious goal) but can also be difficult, since most of the time nothing is appealing to eat and you can start to feel more sick from not eating enough. I have personally had a difficult time drinking water as it has become more unappealing as well. So I have to really push it. My acid reflux is a little worse and my stomach often feels tender. I go back and forth between constipation and diarrhea. I had a couple days of frequent sulfur burps. 
I haven't lost a lot of weight as far as the scale is concerned but have definitely gone down inches and my clothes fit more loosely. I am learning that a lot of other people have been having that same experience. That part of it can be confusing and discouraging at times, but you have to remind yourself you are actually losing weight. I think that side effect is actually somewhat common, but I don't think there are really any answers yet as to why, and that it isn't really a well known aspect outside of those of us experiencing that. Part of it may be due to constipation/fewer bowel movements, slower digestion and bloating.
While it has come with a lot of challenges for sure, I still feel it is tolerable enough for me to continue for now."

I do stick to the diet they recommended for the most part and I exercise 4-6 times a week doing cardio for at least 30 minutes. The only side effect that I have predominately experience is nausea. But because of this I’ve quit smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol which is a huge plus. I can’t even think about either without wanting to gag lol.

My weight has exponentially increased over time. I started Wegovy in March 2023 at 200lbs. Followed the recommended titration, slowly.  I started .25 and then stayed on .5 for two months. I lost 16 pounds in 3 months and was feeling amazing!! Yes, some acid reflux and then slight nausea on dose day but not worse than after a night out of drinking and eating greasy foods!  

Then, the ""supply issue happened"".  It was extremely difficult to locate the 1mg dose and my PCP refused to prescribe the 1.7mg. Most pharmacies I contacted didnt even want to discuss supply and I became frustrated. I tried intermittently to locate 1mg to no avail. I then gained back 8 pounds (but not the 16!). 

I FINALLY found the 1mg dose 2 weeks ago. My pcp recommended I return to .25mg due to possible GI issues but I went for it and took the 1mg as I had minimal to no side effects from the other two doses. Unfortunately, I ate a pretty big meal that evening and then took the 1mg injection. I was sooooo sick all night long, pressure on my stomach and nausea all night. And you cant 'undo' the injection once it's administered. I decided to stop fighting the nausea and vomited the next morning, which made me feel so much better. I was very nauseas for a few days and am happy to say that I am back on track with weight loss with no side effects after my injections (3 so far). Ive lost 6lbs in the past three weeks. 

Due to the lack of appetite, I am making sure my body is getting enough vitamins and minerals by taking supplements and forcing myself to eat things like oatmeal, vegetables etc.  I have a company in my town that will do my labs for a reasonable price which for me is important for holistic wellness (insurance is finicky). I am feeling great and enjoying the idea that my blood pressure and cholesterol issues may reduce as I continue my weight loss journey."

The first few weeks I had side effects, but now I only notice not being hungry the day I take the shot. If  I eat something fried (chicken wings, mozz sticks) or greasy, my bodyreminds me that I shouldn't be eating it and i feel sick (or wake up mltiple times in the night for the restroom)...but honestly, that is not a bad reminder to stay away from those fat/calorie dense foods.

I was at my highest weight 207 lbs and my daughter had just got engaged.  I needed to do something for myself, so when my doctor recommended Ozempic, I decided to try it.  I lost small amounts of weight each week, so was feeling good, but decided I needed some structure, so that I didn't go back to my old habits.  I joined Noom and that kept me paying attention to what I was eatingand where my weight was at.  I felt nauseous and immediately full after a few bites of food, but never got sick.  I couldn't eat greasy food and if I did, I would feel very sick after eating it.  After a few months of Ozempic, I switched to Wegovy because of the shortage but still continued to feel good.  I'm so happy to say that I've lost 60 lbs and am just short of my goal of 140lbs by 5 lbs.  This medication is a miracle for those who have tried unsuccessfully to lose weight on their own.

For example, 2 weeks in, I can only eat like a 3rd of a cheeseburger or a  half of a salad.  Another good by product is that I hardly drink anything alcoholic any more (beer and wine).  Just no craving for it.  When I started week 2 and took my second injection, I was expecting to have to go through hell again.  That did not happen.  Felt great and still do starting my 3rd week.  Lots of energy, no sleep issues, and losing lots of weight.  Just took my 3rd injection yesterday and feel great.  In summary, the first 3 days absolutely sucked for me, but so glad I stuck it out.  Spending a lot less on food and drinking a lot less alcoholic drinks.  Very noticeable weight loss in my face so far.  I am also told that I don't snore anymore (lol).  Hoping this pattern continues over the next couple of months.  Very happy with Wegovy!"

I was at a concert when I tried a vodka lemonaide and ate half a hot dog after not eating all day and just drinking water. 10 minutes later I had horrible abdominal pain. I chalked it up to constipation, but it got so much worse. The pain was different than anything I have ever felt. Even drinking water was killing me. It felt like I swallowed razor blades and my intestines were ripping and my upper backwas shredding into pieces. The pain lasted for 3 days with constant diahrea. I skipped this injection because the pain was worse than my gallbladder surgery. Last night the pain moved to the left upper abdominal area, it felt like I was being stabbed for hours on end. Literally my entire left upper stomach was visably twitching. The pain subsided today, im still constipated, extremly bloated, and tired as hell. Only 3 weeks in and I feel horrible. Please be careful."

I was weak my first weak but I hadn’t been taking my vitamins. I started taking them and everything got better. I took my third shot today and haven’t felt sick all day. I was surprised.

Thats what drugs do. They give side effects to combat an ailment. Even multivitamins can cause vomiting, dehydration, gi issues and lightheadedness. If you don't use as prescribed then it is not the med to blame. If you expect to take a shot and wake up tomorrow 100lbs less you will be disappointed. 

I have had side effects but got through it. It wasn't pleasant but I got through it. I am happy to stay close to a bathroomonce a week if it means my body can be in less pain because of my weight. Getting older sucks way more when excess weight mixes with normal wear and tear. 
I do think that too many people are not realistic about what this does. It doesn't fix everything by itself and nothing is going to give you that social media glow that isn't real to begin with. Even when you do lose a lot in the end, you now have another round of new problems. You look like a deflated balloon and are dealing with the complexity of being a fat person in a stranger's skinny body. 

Moral of this story. If this works the way you think it should you didn't need it to begin with. If you quit because you don't like the side effects, you didn't need this to begin with. Some of us are desperate, including myself, and will do anything to feel less pain. No one should stay on a med they don't like but don't blame it all on the drug."
Semaglutide,Wegovy,8/3/2023,Elizabeth,25-34,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,2.6666666666666665,2,4,2,1.0,0,"I have been taking Wegovy since the end of April 2023. Due to supply issues, I took 2-months worth of the .25 dose and then now 2-months worth of the .5 dose. I have one more dose of the .5ml pen left, but have put off taking it due to experiencing extreme side effects last week (the 2nd time this has happened). It feels like a really bad case of the flu, mixed with nausea, vertigo, a horrible headache, fatigue, and having a very hot, flushed face that I cannot cool down no matter what I do. I can’t stand for more than a few seconds at a time either. It’s seriously awful. I have been prescribed nausea medication and will still sometimes throw up out of nowhere. Mostly like acid reflux. I noticed that this has happened a day or two after taking my 6th or 7th shot of the SAME dose. It is almost unbearable. Also, it is really scary that these side effects can appear seemingly out of nowhere when other weeks I feel mostly fine (maybe not ever 100% but manageable). I think these side effects may also be corresponding with my period, but that’s just a theory. So, adding that into the mix is the cherry on top of what is a horrible experience. 

Some weeks I feel less hungry than others, but it has never been consistent or gotten progressively “better” with each week. I already try to drink a ton of water, but have upped my water intake even more since starting the medication in hopes of helping avoid any potential side effects. I have also tried to incorporate more protein and veggies into my diet and stay away from really greasy foods or lots of sugar. Again, some days or weeks are better than others, but overall, I have made some decent improvements to my diet and still haven’t been able to lose much weight or keep off the little bit I have lost. When I’m not experiencing extreme fatigue or any other side effects, I am usually able to exercise 2-3 times a week. But if the fatigue creeps up on me? Forget about it. It will feel like I’ve been drugged.

Overall, I’m disappointed that the medication hasn’t worked the way I’ve heard it has for others. My doctor reminded me that not everyone experiences rapid weight loss in the first few months, but I guess I just assumed (or hoped) that’s what would happen. She feels that my progress is good enough/gradual and that if I can get my hands on the medication during these crazy shortages then I should try to push through. However, risking feeling like death 2-3 days every 6 weeks has me questioning if it’s worth it. I want to be the healthiest version of myself, but have never found it easy to lose weight without crash dieting. As I get older and my metabolism slows, it only becomes increasingly more difficult. I want to be heart healthy, have energy, and feel my best. So far, Wegovy has occasionally made me feel less hungry, but the anxiety and stress that comes with experiencing side effects and dealing with supply chain issues/coverage is a lot."

Started on 1/15 at 277 pounds down to 201 6 months later. It slows the digestive system, so I took on an empty stomach though instructions says it doesn't matter. Minor side effects. Headaches and the runs the first 2 days and the runs when I upped to the 1.7 dosage for about 10 days. Only other side effect was fatigue. Though when I'm fatigued that's when the weight comes off. Doctor kept me on the .25 doseage for the first 3 months, .50 for the next 2 months, 1.0 for a month and just started the 1.7 doseage 2 weeks ago. 
   Was able to eat the foods I like, though I avoided pasta, bread and sugar foods, diet mainly meat and baked potato. Wegovy curbed my carb addiction considerably, snacking reduced by about 80 percent and meals by about 40 percent. 
   Had a few periods when the weight loss stalled for 7 to 10 days. I lost weight before but never this easy. The cravings for food went away within an hour of 1st injection."

All sorts of abnormal labs for kidney function, electrolytes, metaboloc acidosis and messed up red blood counts. Prior to that dose, I was doing great, exercising daily, sticking to my lifestyle changes and happy with the results. Now I'm weak and unable to exercise, work, concentrate, feeling unmotivated, tired, moody, and anxious. It feels like I'm literally dying and there's nothing that helps. It's everything I can do to force myself to eat and drink a little bit.  This med doesn't help that much to justify feeling like absolute hell, mentally and physically for weeks after stopping it. I see that many people experience the same gigantic kick in the face at the 1.0 to 1.7 mg dose . I wish there was an antidote, I would pay anything to end this torture.

I have lost 15 pounds, so I will say it is very effective. I am currently at the 1mg weekly dose, and it is rough. Since the start of this medication, I have had a general ""queasy"" feeling almost all the time. My appetite is definitely decreased. I have also had some dizziness and fatigue and it has interfered some with my workouts. I was eating low carb and exercising regularly before starting Wegovy, but was at a weight plateau. I started this because of my A1C (prediabetic) and triglyceride levels, and I believe weight loss will help both these numbers. I know to avoid weight regain, I will probably have to be on this indefinitely. At this point, however, I don't think I will go above the current 1mg dose, at least for a few months, because the side effects on this dose are pretty bad. Queasy all the time with intermittent nausea, constipation, fatigue, some dizziness during my workouts. I am hoping with time these will get better as the weight loss continues.

I’m giving a review because mostly people with bad reactions leave reviews here and my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. It was working so well for me that I did each dose for a few months before increasing to the next level. I’m just now starting the 2.4mg dose and although I’m nervous, it’s worth it because the results are so good. 

I had a bmi of 31 when Istarted and now it’s is 24. I’ve lost about 28% of my body weight and now look and feel great. All my arthritis is gone! I did have some pretty significant nausea and constipation for a few months, but I only vomited once. Some headaches too and just not feeling great. But the longer you’re on it, it seems to get better and I mostly don’t have any side effects anymore. We will see with this new highest dose. 

When I had to stop for 4 months, I gained back about 14 lbs, so that’s why I started it up again. I intend to stay on it so that I can keep the weight off. Totally worth it, for me, and just hoping I don’t get any serious side effects from long term use. I recommend people try it if they qualify.

I don't restrict things, but as an overall healthy eater and Vegetarian, this works wonderfully for my lifestyle. People really need to do their research, though. You are meant to slowly titrate up the doses so that you can eliminate or reduce the side effects. There are ways to deal with the side effects when you have them- drink more water, eat plenty of protein, etc. The therapeutic dose doesn't even start til 1.0mg-1.7mg and many do not lose anything until then, so you have to be patient. I'm one of the lucky ones whose had great success from the beginning, but I do lead a healthy lifestyle. I feel like my body is finally working the way it's meant to. Exercise, choose foods to fuel your body, eat lots of protein so you don't lose muscle mass, and be patient. Don't compare your journey to anyone else's."

Nauseous and vomiting during the first 2 weeks. My doctor does well with keeping up with my progress and since day one has mentioned increasing my fluid intake. By reading other reviews dehydration seems to be a big issue for people. Hopefully this continues to work for me and I reach my goal with only 24lbs left to lose.

I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but this abdominal pain was by far the worst I have ever dealt with. I took 4 weeks of 0.25 followed by 1 dose of 0.5 (the correct dose schedule according to manufacturer) and 6 days later I was in the hospital. I have not taken another does since. But- my GI tract is still not right. It took at least one week to deal with the aftermath of the hospital visit, and now, 3.5 weeks out frommy last dose, I still get queasy/nauseous 1-2 times weekly, so much so that I have to take Zofran, which barely touches it. And BTW- the nauseousness lasts for at least 12 hours, it's not a quick, passing thing. This ""medication"" is dangerous even when used correctly. I did read all these reviews before starting so was hesitant but went ahead anyway, and thought after a month that I skirted around any side effects, but I was totally wrong. Never again and don't do it. It's not worth it."

Wegovy  gave me abdominal cramps so bad I had to go an ER. I was very dehydrated and in so much pain. Luckily my CT was normal, but my WBC was elevated. Maybe this is some other side effect that will start being reported more often now that half the population seems to be taking it. I started at the 0.25 and did that weekly for 4 weeks. During that time, I was ok but constantly felt somewhat bloated and would burp way more than what would be considered normal. Then came 0.5, one dose. 6 days later I was in the ER. It's now 1 week later, and my GI tract is still not normal. I am glad some people had success with this but for me, my life was way better before this medication. I'll take 15# overweight and feeling great to this any day. My next visit is to a GI doctor. I just hope there is no permanent damage.Thanks for the misery, Wegovy. Never again.

So far I have had minimal side effects. I’m more sensitive to the cold, sometime have indigestion and definitely have constipation that I need to take colace for but besides that I have no other side effects.  I have loss 14lbs in 4 weeks. I am combining this with weight watchers so I am pretty careful about what I’m eating. Wegovy seems to make it possible for me to avoid the cravings I generally have.  Part of it has been fear of getting sick from all the reviews but I think it’s also that it makes me feel pretty full longer.  I do still experience hunger but I am definitely able to eat way less and still feel satisfied. my insurance covers it and it’s working so I’m happy to continue on the same dosage for another course (4 weeks).

I had acid reflux and 1/2 way into the night I through up. You would have thought I learned my  lesson. So I havehad a few headaches and diarrhea bur nothing to hard. Losing 50 lbs I feel so much better and with the 1.7 I have noticed I don't feel hungry at all today. I am so glad I started this and my wife is on it she felt nauseous her first day on .50 dose but at a little and was fine. I am a believer

I initially lost 9 pounds the first month while on the .25.  During the second month while on .50 I lost nothing(I also didn’t exactly give any effort).  After starting the 1.0 I started losing weight again, towards the end of the month my weight loss started to slow down again.  I am now on my first month of the 1.7 and am losing weight again. For the first time I have a side effect of fatigue.  But what do you expect when you don’t eat?  This will be my last month as I have hit my goal.  

Overall I am happy and would recommend.  Only negatives is the price and the fatigue once I started the 1.7."

Could be a fluke, could be a difference between scales, I am going to weigh myself again at the doctors office using their scale where I initially weighed in, for a more accurate comparison. Overall I’m very pleased. No insomnia. No cravings. I’m definitely eating less and feeling better. My clothes are also telling the tale, fitting much better with no bloating."

Went away after two days. Took my shot again the same thing happened only worse. I ended up in the ER because the stomach pain was so bad it was worse than I ever could imagine. Had two bags of IV CT scan to make sure everything was ok and said that my stomach was distended and my hiatal hernia was inflamed. Also during the first two months of the shot I was stagnant with weight lose.

I have also increased my water intake. It definitely has decreased my appetite significantly. I am struggling to get my protein intake up. I concentrate on protein and vegetables at my meals.

I was really hoping this would be the answer to my weight loss journey.  I began Wegovy with .25 five weeks ago. I have lost five pounds. This drug has had a strange outcome for me. The scale stayed the same for eight days straight. It wasn’t until I expelled a week’s worth of #2 that I finally lost another 1.5 pounds. At the beginning, I didn’t go to the bathroom for nine days. I was miserable. I tried senacot  and Miralax together before I finally went. 
Thishas been a horrible and disappointing experience.  It has made me depressed and lethargic, not to mention the stomach pain every day. Last week I went to the .50 dose. Worst week of my life. I have eight grandchildren and can’t even enjoy them because I’m so sad and sick. I have struggled with weight loss since I was 50. Thank goodness I am tall or I would look like a cow. I have three injections left and I’m not sure I can put myself through this for three more weeks.

I drink lots of water. Also one time I pushed the pen into myskin and it didn’t click to dispense the medication so I lifted up the pen and ended up wasting a lot of the medication ??. Lastly I always take out the pen out of the fridge on dosing days in the mornings then dose at night but not right before bed time.

Working with my Nurse Practitioner to monitor side effects and tolerance to medication.  So far so good.  My Nurse Practitioner also has me adhering to proper nutrition and exercise in addition to taking the medication. 
Working with dietitian to change eating habits and that has been a good experience.  I like the approach because the first 3 months we focused on adding a new goal in terms of nutrition focus so as not to have to worry about everything at once.  My water, protein, carbs and fat each day are now where they should be for me.  Its not so overwhelming now trying to meet my daily goals.  The medication is just helping me not focus on food or being hungry while doing this.  
I have experienced some nausea after the injection but seems to go away after a day or so. We will see how this goes as the dosage increases.  Some foods i dont seem to tolerate as well but they are foods I should not have regulary as a part of my new behaviors anyway so I am ok with that.  Also now understand that those items are choices as well but should not be a regular choice so again the medication is helping with behavior changes. 
On the .25 and .5 dose i did lose weight but nothing remarkable, but this is probably more related to me working on smaller manageable Nutritional goals. 
I am have more significant loss each week with the 1g dose so I imagine this will continue as the dose increases.
After reading some of the reviews I would say your best experience with the medication is partnering with a provider who knows about the treatment of obesity so that you can get all the tools needed to have a good experience.  The medication alone is not enough."

I just took my 6th injection today 3/23/23, and am currently at 35 pounds. My BP has already dropped from 130s/90s, to 90s/70s, and have been removed from my first BP Med. 

Ease of Use: Once you get the needle out of your head, it is an easy injection. Both injections on 1.0 have been 'light', as it doesnt feel like the needle is going as deep as the last 8 doses. Todays dose wasleaky, even with the needle in and pressing hard. I'll try again next week to see, it'll still do it's job even if some leaked out.

Satisfaction: Overall I'm satisfied, I haven't had much of a change in taste, but have noticed I am definitely more sensitive to smells triggering retching. Nausea for .25 and .5 were very mild, with 1.0 being on the slightly higher side of moderate. The night of the first 1.0, was horrible; But that was my own doing, having eaten heavier foods through the day before the injection, today seems to be back to a more mild sensation, eating like I had been the previous dose days. My partner has been absolutely supportive through this, adjusting his diet to closer to mine. I've mostly stuck to a sausage egg and cheese JD Delight sandwich for breakfast, raw veggies with a yogurt based dressing, or chicken patties with salsa for lunch, and pretty much whatever has been made for dinner. I have greatly reduced overall carb intake, getting closer to a keto diet but not strict. Something you MUST do is tell yourself to eat. My first 2 days after my first injection were very hanger ragey. Lesson learned. Beef seems to be a trigger food for nausea now. One side effect I've experienced more often than anything has been dizziness on standing. The first time I experienced it, it was quick as I was actually getting up from crouching; I actually had to lay down for a minute to come back to myself. Since then, I've either sat back down or just stood and braced myself against something. The removal from the first BP med seems to have really lightened up that side effect though. Outside of that, I am gassy from both ends, but I can't tell if that's the Wegovy or the CPAP at this time; Probably both... but the drug is doing what it's designed to do. I am trying to tell myself to endulge more, as I am somewhat concerned with how fast the weight is coming off... thinking maybe my blood sugar has been getting lower than it should be (have never been diagnosed diabetic), but feel like that could have also been contributing to the dizziness. It has mostly curbed my sweet tooth, I do endulge in a little bit as dessert towards the end of the night, usually a serving of peanut butter cups, trying to include more fruit as well; But overall just learning to be more mindful of what I'm actually putting in, since I'm eating about 1/3 of what I would have before, so that what is going in is actually nutritious. I haven't started getting back into the gym yet, but am planning on it and becoming more active as the weather is getting nicer. I work from home, and have become accustomed to... remaining warm, since I'm now also cold much more easily.

TL:DR, you have to figure out what works for you, what triggers symptoms more severely and how to mitigate them. Having a support system WITH you, not just online, via people who are willing to make these changes alongside you also makes a HUGE difference."

I've been losing at a rate that is slow but very steady.  I am convinced that like many things, the reviews here are naturally an adverse selection in that people with a bad experience are far more likely to write reviews. My only side effects have been tiredness the day after shots, and occassional mild nausea.  The nausea was really just during the first few weeks, I assume as my body was getting used to this. I am 3 months in. 1 month .25 and 2 months .5. This medicine helps me eat less. I'm never starving between meals and when I do eat I simply don't want as much. I have noticed that as the week goes on I get hungrier and I have days where I eat over 2000 calories sometimes when I near my next dose. I am very happy with this med.

The shots are so painless, I sometimes check to make sure I was the autoject pen actually worked (I inject in my abdoment. I have lost 15 pounds rather effortlessly. The main benefit I have noticed is I am no longer fixated on food. I don't think about eating constantly or have the desire to snack throughout the day nor do I eat voraciously. I started off at 231 pounds (I am a 56 year old male, 5' 10"" tall). That weight put me in the obese category with a BMI of 30. After five weeks, I am at 215 pounds. 

I have reduced my caloric intake by at least 1/2. I am fuller faster and can stop eating with food still on the plate. It has also increased my ability to reject evening snacks. I still think about them occasionally but I am able to resist the urge rather easily. 

As far as side effects, there have been a few minor ones. I started off with a dose of .25 mg and on month two it was increased to .50 mg. The side effects I have experienced were mild to moderate and only happened when I ate too much food i.e. binging. When I ate more than a human being should, I had stomach aches, mild nausea, cramps, and acid reflux. Again, this correlates directly to overeating. The psychological effect of cause and effect (eat too much and suffer moderate physical discomfort) is also beneficial to changing my relationship with food.  I learned rather quickly that binging has a negative consequence. 

I think many of the negative stories about Wegovy can be traced to people either being initially given too large a dose or people thinking this is a miracle drug that will allow you to eat the way that made you obese and still lose weight. It is not a panacea that will allow you to continue to overeat. It is a significant resource to curb cravings and slow down digestion making you feel fuller with less food and also holding you accountable for your bad eating habits should you try to continue them. 

I have found that increasing your water intake and adding fiber supplements to your diet can minimize the side effects of constipation and diarrhea. 

My goal weight is 185. If I can maintain my current weight loss trajectory, I should hit that in three to four months. I had almost given up on losing weight until I was able to get this drug. I am extremely happy with the results and feel the minor side effects I have experienced are completely acceptable and manageable. If used as part of a reduced-calorie diet and with added physical activity, I believe Wegovy can help many people reach healthier weights in relatively short periods of time with minimal side effects."

I was able to get a few bites of chocolate and crackers down and went home. I'd already messaged my doc about the nausea and he called in some Zofran. My husband picked themup and brought them home to me. I took one and laid down. About an hour later, I sat straight up and flew to the bathroom. I projectile vomited harder than I ever have in my life. I could hardly catch my breath it was coming out so fast. Then the diarrhea hit and I was doing both at the same time. And if that wasn't enough, I had another hypoglycemic attack during all of that. I was pouring sweat. It was running off of me like I was standing in the rain, rapid heart rate, dizzy and my blood sugar was so low I was barely responsive when my husband came to check on me. He called 911 and I stayed 3 days in the hospital receiving fluids, glucose and nausea meds. I'm home now but I'm still nauseous, bloated and my kidneys are hurting now.

I started Wegovy and just took my 4th week's dose of 0.25mg. I have not had any side effects and found it to be a very effective appetite suppressant. I have, like many others, tried dieting and dieting programs, my last one was Metabolic Weight Loss center. This is a keto-esque program that bids you to increase protein, lower carbs, lots of water, exercise, yada yada yada. But, of course those things don't work very well for me and I feel like a failure, or it does work for a while and then I gain weight again as I live my life. I am a stress/boredom eater, and also eat larger portions that I should. Wegovy was prescribed due to my starting weight of 215 lbs @ 5'7'', and elevated cholesterol levels, which I am on medication for. I did increase my exercise, from nil to trying to go to aquatic exercises, 2-3x/week for 45 mins. So far, I am down to 204 lbs without much effort. I realize that a significant weight loss will be very helpful with my back issues going forward and hopefully will relieve painful flare ups with arthritis, degenerative disc disease, for which i get cortisone injections a few times a year, and allow me to not have to use a CPAP machine.  But, I am a bit concerned that I may begin having side effects with the elevated dosages and may ask if I can stay on lower doses for a longer pd of time, especially since it is working. I read that sometimes people have gallbladder problems if they lose too much weight too soon, so I definitely want to avoid any of that.  Also, to be honest, I am concerned what will happen when I finish with this rx and what tools will I be able to use to keep all or much of the weight off. I will also disclose that I did research all of the common medications for weight loss that are now being used. My Endocrinologist said that Wegovy was one of the better weight loss drugs, and that it not only helps with weight loss but in some cases may save many lives as well from diabetes and heart disease."

The first month has been all about adjustment and transitioning to a new way of thinking. Wegovy is a tool to help curb appetite and cravings, which it does for me. In the past, while decreasing food intake for weight loss, I was always so hungry  - and now I am not, and this has been amazing. My cravings for salty snacks and sugar have decreased significantly. I eat a smaller amount of the bad stuff and am satisfied. 

My barriers at this point are psychological - I still want to eat too much at the wrong times, I still want to drink wine, neither of which should you do on this medication. Your GI tract slows, and food and drink stay in your GI tract longer. If you overeat, you will feel awful. If you drink too much alcohol, you will feel awful. In an effort not to feel awful, I have been adjusting portion size and when I eat. I am trying to be aware of these issues - this has been why I have only lost about 3-4 pounds in 5-weeks. Still a victory considering how difficult it is for me to lose weight. (50yo F, 5’10”, starting 232#, current 228#.)

The only side effect I had during the first month was fatigue. It was significant! However, my PCP suggested increasing my protein (wow, was I not getting enough), and I also became more mindful of hydration. An increase in protein, and hydration, and a decrease in meal portion and wine turned it around. I feel great now! But it wasn’t easy. The struggle is real, still. Lots of work left! Fingers crossed for the next 6-weeks!"

I am writing to share in the very poor 1 star section an observation about the comments posted here. First, there are quite a few in which the dose does not begin at .25 but much higher, including in one case 1.7mg because the lowest dose was unavailable. The instructions tell the user to work up the levels starting with .25mg so it is understandable you can become quite sick starting with much higer doses. Second, people claimno weight loss at all despite being on the med for months. However they don't share whether they are exercising and eating a low calorie diet. One person said he lost nothing including his appetite so just ate as normal. Maybe his dose had to be higher? Finally, one person claimed to have extreme vomiting, headaches, etc. and that he was eating 500 calories per day.  500 calories is not a low calorie diet that is starvation. Perhaps that is why he had terrible side effects.  In summary, if you are going to complain and be dissatisfied (or even super happy) do explain the basics about your diet, your exercise, on what dosage you have had the problem.  Thanks for sharing."

I have read about others having issues with fried foods, I don't eat fried foods but I can see it could be problematic.  3. Don't overeat.  Listen to that ""full"" signal your body is sending you.  Over eating leads to some bad side effects.  Just realize you are only able to take in so much food at once. 4.  Plan what you eat and prioritize nutrient dense foods.  You can only eat so much so you need to plan your meals.  

Adapting to this medication is not difficult if you listen to your body.  I am still learning how to live on this medication but I am confident in the long run it will work.  I also meet with my Doctor once a month to ensure that everything is ok."

Started on the .25mg injection and woke up the next day thinking I had covid or influenza because I had HORRIBLE body aches and fatigue. Went to the Dr and was negative for both so then it dawned on me it might be the Wegovy. Could barely  function for the next 3 days I felt so bad and was extremely fatigued. Decided maybe that was just a bad reaction to the first injection so went ahead with the 2nd. 24 hrs later the fatigue is worse, keep falling asleep while working from home and in the evenings. Nauseous and nothing tastes good except for bland food. On overwhelming feeling of severe depression kicked in after the 2nd injection and I've decided I'm done!!"

I have noticed as I have gotten older it is in my head with the thought I am hungry plus I am a stress eater so I needed help more so with the “food intake” piece.  I started this journey in September starting at 247 pounds.  I do t want to pretend it has been so wonderful because my body hasdefinitely seen the wrath in good and bad ways.  I started out the first month at .25mg and am now in January 2023 worked up to 2.5mg.  The first month I didn’t see much in weight loss but definitely noticed a HUGE difference in my appetite.  After the first month I did see the weight start to fall off.  I want to add I was not exercising at all.  My food intake was less and then came some of the not so pleasant things.  Diarrhea, stomach pain, breaking out in a full body sweat but thankfully no throwing up.  However, all of that I described was just as bad.  This would happen when I would make a poor food choice that maybe had a little grease or spice in it.  I did pay for these decisions and for a while I thought this was going to be the new norm and I along with my husband asked myself more than once is it worth it.  I can still say almost February 2023 it is.  I haven’t had one of those spells at 3am for a long time now but I also don’t eat like I once did.  I am now down over 40lbs and still have a ways to go with this journey.  I will say and want to stress everyone is different including how your body will react to this.  Just like any weight loss you want to take this slow and start with the lower dose to get your body used to this as well as that is what your Dr should be giving.  I know we are a world who wants to see results right now but with this you will just give it time and don’t force higher doses or you could be quitting before you truly begin due to side affects.  Some takeaways for me.  When you are prescribed this make sure to ask for some anti nausea medication as well.  I have zofran and I am positive that is the only reason I didn’t have vomiting with my side affects.  If you have sulfer burps which I started experiencing the end of December get on some anti acid medication.  I take omeprezol and it is a life saver.  Also try and remember why you are doing this.  I look at my parents (who I have now introduced to this as well) and want to be on better health and be there for my husband, kids and now grandchild.  You have to consider what is best for you.  Don’t feel guilty for wanting to help yourself, just be smart about it.  We all go at different paces and I do believe after the research and my own experience this works.  Good Luck"
Semaglutide,Wegovy,1/24/2023,Sungoddess,55-64,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5.0,5,5,5,,1,"Been on Wegovy for 3 weeks now.  The first week I actually felt full for the first time in 40 years where I didn't want to keep eating like I usually do.  I literally cried.  Feeling full is such a wonderful feeling.  I do need to train myself to stop eating when I'm full, that it's ok to not eat everything on my plate since I'm a compulsive overeater and that it's taboo to leave food on your plate. Once I eat my first meal of the day and I'll stop when I'm full, I'm then full for the rest of the day and don't even want to eat dinner.  I believe that eating very small meals during the day will be a benefit for me in making sure I don't starve myself. I really don't want to eat because of feeling full and that's scary for me.  I am getting help professionally in re-teaching my mind.  My sleep schedule is off, I'm wide awake at night and I do get sick to my stomach with a headache more so in the evening then during the day.  I've also noticed that my taste buds have changed and I'm not tasting the food that same way before I started Wegovy.  I've also noticed that my sense of smell is off as well.  I am so stoked to losing 100 plus pounds and pray that I'll be able to stop taking Wegovy without going back to my old ways once the weight is off. Long way to go so I'm not dwelling on it.  Good luck to everyone who is taking Wegovy for weight loss."

I've tried and failed at diets and exercise programs for most of my adult life. I can lose weight with extreme calorie restriction and exercise, but the miserable extremes I have to go to are unsustainable in the long-term. Now menopause is looming, and the weight has been creeping up, even with diet and exercise. 

I started 0.25 mg Wegovy in late Dec, and will be taking my 4th shot tomorrow. I have experienced mild appetite suppression, enough tohelp me shed almost 3 lbs so far (yeah, it's still hard). I have definitely reduced my food intake, and do find it easier to eat smaller portions and make healthier choices, as my cravings are somewhat reduced. I found that my 3rd shot didn't produce the same appetite suppression as the first two, so I'm hoping that graduating to 0.5 mg will give stronger effects. I travel a lot for work, so it can be difficult to make healthy choices on the road, but Wegovy does seem to help.

I have experienced very mild side effects: slight nausea (mostly just when I wake up an night to pee) and constipation (I suffer with this anyway, and take Metamucil, stool softeners, and magnesium). The last few days I've become exhausted in the afternoons and MUST take a quick nap, but I've also been under a tremendous amount of work/family stress, so that could explain it. 

Overall I'm happy with Wegovy, and feel optimistic for the future. My (new as of 1/1/23) insurance provider (BCBS) denied my pre-auth due to lack of 3 months of diet and lifestyle modification, but my doctor is appealing, as I've been doing that for 30 years! Fingers crossed."

It started working almost immediately.  I’m on several medications for heart related issues from Covid but all was stable.  Was nervous about taking this medication but did my research and discussions with doctors.  After a few days of the injection I developed a severe allergic reaction of hives/ rash.  I’ve still lost about 6 pounds in the past week but unfortunately can’t continue.  I’m one of the very few people who this has happened to, however, it was a possible side effect.  I worried about the other side effects, however, I didn’t experience any of those."

I followed Mounjaro’s plan for 3 months until the $25 trials ended. During the mounjaro trial I lost 45 pounds in 90 days. I need to add I went on a protein shake diet. There were a few carbs thrown in there, but I really tried to go to as few carbs as possible. 

Now that Wegovy is available again and my insurance covers it, I’m on Wegovy. I started on a low dose compared to where I was on Mounjaro. The 1st week didn’t produce much weight loss or appetite control. My Doc doubled my dose and I definitely can feel a difference. My appetite is gone again. 

One word of warning about Mounjaro. In my case the constipation was off the chart. I had to be very careful what I ate and if was much at all (a slice of pizza at a party did 
me in) I had to use stool softeners, a laxative and eventually drink mineral oil to break up the road block. Seriously bad situation. Be careful."

Wegovy keeps me feeling full and allows me to make good choices with serving size. I have only taken it twice. The first week I lost 6 pounds because I just felt satisfied with very small servings and lasted so I could make it meal to meal. With that being said, I did make healthy-ish choices: soup, salad, salmon, grilled chicken...It is painless and easy to use. I was nervous to administer my own shot but they made it very easy. I am tolerating it very well. I feel lucky that I have only slight nausea and fatigue but it subsided after 1 day."

Reducing one’s weight is never going to be easy and this does require trial and error at first.  Very few issues after 6 weeks. I now inject on Friday evenings in case I am mildly tired Day One or Day Two.  Never both days.  Ask your doc for an anti-nausea medication before you start as you may need it the first several weeks.  Works great!    One that doesn’t make you drowsy.  Also have Tums and/or Pepcid. You will quickly learn sitting up straight allows you to quickly release acid buildup. Immediate relief.  Will also need to increase fiber and perhaps consider stool softener.  Stay on top of this and don’t hesitate to ask your doc about your symptoms versus being miserable.  As with any weight loss, a steady, but small decline is great.  Don’t worry if you plateau on occasion.  But we can’t continue eating the same things and not exercising!  I’m not a clinical person but I do suspect some people have more issues because they have more health issues overall."

This week, I expected to see a big drop, as last week I went up 0.2 lbs.  I am extremely disappointed.  My food intake has decreased.  I did not have the nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that some have reported.  I was not eating much when I started the medication, and that may be why.   I did have extreme fatigue which I countered by drinking Zipfizz (electrolytes and vitamins - specifically B).  I was ready to quit and they bumped me up this week, so we'll see if I start losing.  I started at 268 and now am at 263.2.  Less than 5 lbs in 4 weeks.  For the cost and the risk, so far it is not worth it.  In 2019 I lost almost 40 lbs doing Keto and Carb Manager.  My weight started creeping back, and I thought I'd try this ""no diet"" wonder drug.  I was hoping that using this medication would allow me to put fruit and whole grains back into my diet and help me limit those carbs.  Unfortunately, it just may be for my body, Keto is the only plan that works.  I just got sick of counting everything.  The center said that you don't really start losing weight until the dosage is increased and that they want to make sure your body tolerates it well.  I paid for 10 weeks, but am thinking that it just isn't going to be effective for me.  I would have been happy with 2 lbs per week, which, I don't think is too much to ask given the cost.  If I have to count carbs and calories, what is the point?  Keto keeps away the insulin spikes so you're not hungry.  This was supposed to be effortless... but if you've already changed your diet and don't eat much, it just might not work.  Maybe it's my age and being post menopausal.  I was hoping to lose weight to save my joints more than vanity."

It definitely curbed my appetite though which is the intent of the meds. I tried to stick with the process hoping that my body would eventually adjust.I took nausea meds, Advil for the constant headaches, ate TUMS like candy, and took Prilosec twice a dat. I followed up with two more injections. But the side effects are just too much for me to take. I am nauseated almost constantly, burp all the time, am constipated, have a constant headache and have severe fatigue. I already have bouts of diverticulitis which I think are now aggravated by the constipation. I don't want to lose but about 20 pounds so I think I will have to go another route.

I may find that I come back and add another review later that is rated higher, 

 Brief background on me, I have been a gym rat since 2008, very healthy, I eat lean chicken, veggies, and complex carbs, no added sugars, no processed foods and only drink water, green tea, and milk... 

 but I was post-menopausal in my late 30s and which caused massive weight gain (60 pounds), though my diet and exercise never changed.  

Got on HRT andlost 20lbs but could not get under 200lbs. My weight fluctuated between 200-230 for 3 years..  I even intermittently fasted. 

 I asked my doctor about Wegovy and I was given a prescription.  My labs are good, no high glucose so insurance wouldn't cover it.  I filled my script at a compound pharmacy.  They mix it with B12 and I get it for $150 per month. 

 I  need to go from 211 pounds to 150.  The pharmacist told me to take 15-20 units. 

 The next day I took 18 units and felt great!  Not hungry, very focused, no side effects- I always drink a gallon of water a day...  

In comes the nightmare of my first night... 

 I normally take 1/2 of CBD gummy at night to help me get a full 8 hours of sleep... so as usual, I ate it and went to bed at 10 pm.  

At 10:30pm I got super hot, dizzy and massive sweats...so much that my hair was soaked.  I ended up passing out in the bathroom, falling face down... I had to be rushed to the hospital as I kept losing consciousness, I had all the severe side effects, minus nausea.

  After about 7 hours I was released.  

Turns out, that the CDB interacted with it, and plus I was only supposed to take 12 units. The combo of CBD AND taking too much (not preloaded injectors) caused severe reactions. 

 I have been fine since.  

No more CBD!  

 My current problem now is am not sleeping at night.   So I am unclear if the CBD gummy caused the reaction or if it did so because I took too many units of Wegovy.. either way, I am waking up at 3 am.. ugh.  I don't know what to do to stay asleep as I am scared of taking ANYTHING to help me sleep as I never want to experience what I did the first night.   

Taking the sleep issue out of the equation.  I lost 8 pounds in my first week and I feel fine. This is the first time in 3 years the scale or my measurements MOVED DOWNWARDS! 

Those who want to take this: Make sure you tell your doctor EVERYTHING!  

You have to change your diet to avoid nausea, gas, and those types of side effects.   Eating carbs, sugary things or over-eating will cause stomach issues.   

Cool it on the caffeine and get plenty of water.  keep track of your food and how you are feeling and stay in contact with your healthcare provider.  

If I can go back to 8 hours of sleep, then I can raise my rating.  I am looking forward to this journey of finally moving out of the category of Obese!  I will be contacting my doctor to see what we can do about my sleep. Other than that, I am satisfied."

The only side effect I did experience was a little bit of nausea in the morning. I had used with Wegovy for seven months and have currently been off of it now for four month and continued to still lose weight. My insurance covered it and I had to pay $100 per month, but if you go onto the Wegovy website and sign up for their training you get a prescription card that makes that will go be only $25."

I'm barely 5 ft tall and aging. I've fought my weight for so many years that it was depressing and exhausting. I lost over 70 lbs in 2020 and gained most of it back between summer of 2021 into Spring of 2022. I did not know anything about wegovy until Spring of 2022. I've lost an average of 10 lbs a month and I'm currently down 58 lbs going into my 6 months of using wegovy. I hate giving myself a shot but this works. Side effects for me are minimal. Someoneelse posted it's like a gastric bypass without surgery. I would say compared to what I watched my mom go through because she opted for the surgery this is close on the effectiveness but the side effects are not as bad as undergoing surgery. I would recommend to anyone that has been in the battle for a long time and it seems like nothing works. It works if you stay with it and push through the not so great days. The good days outweigh the bad.

I started at 247lbs standing at 5’9” I did show as Obese on my BMI. I am now 177lbs which means I have lost 70 lbs in 5 months. This medication is a miracle worker but I have spent about $100 on vitamins, laxatives, and other medications to help with the side effects. If you are serious about weight loss the side effects are just something you have to deal with. I have nausea, constipation, vomiting, low iron, and a multitude of just other little things. I highly recommend buying ginger ale, multi vitamins, vitamin D, and a probiotic to help reduce symptoms. I LOVE WEGOVY!"

Use some Zofran 1st two weeks for nausea.  I have learned what I can and cannot eat on this medicine.   More of a mediterranean or paleo diet.  Has been wonderful for me.  Lost 40 lbs since March.  Listen to your body tell you it is full.  If you over eat, you will be miserable for a while.  One word of advise... You cannot eat late and go to bed.  You will have indigestion, nausea, etc as mentioned in the other comments.READ ABOUT THE MEDICINE, then decide it it is for you."

I've lost 11 pounds even though I skipped a week( the fifth week) when I went on a summer trip that involved a long flight. (I didn't want to be sick over the Pacific and stuck on a plane.) My insurance surprisingly covered it, probably bc I have tried all sorts of things over years to lose weight.  I started off needing to lose 20 pounds but hopefully 30.  I was quite sick with vomiting the very first dose of the first week, for oneday.  Hwr, since then I take a Zofran an hour before the injection and do this right before bed.  I have experienced all the negative side effects at some point or another, but feel they are all manageable. I'm a bit frightened to go up to the 2.4mg dose, but I'm just planning ahead for a couple of rough days.The worst for me is the fatigue. I used to work out more, but now I'm without energy. I'm just making the choice to do it anyway, and I do feel better when I do. I do not plan to take this medication for the rest of my life, but I'm not sure how getting off of it looks. I am very curious about the science of this medicine and how to stay at a healthy BMI without it.  I was prescribed Plentity before this, and I stockpiled it with the plan to take it after I finish Wegovy. My doctor isn't sure this will work."

I did not, fortunately. Some loss of appetite, but I figured that was kinda the point, at least at first. I had a little nasua the 
first week on .5, but it went awayin a couple of weeks and never came back.  When I do eat, I enjoy my food. I am just able to eat less, and less frequently, without being uncomfortable or stressed. I have been on it for about 10 months now, topping off at 2 mg. I have lost over 30 pounds, which since I am short was almost 25% of my body weight and has made a tremendous difference. It would be best if I lose about 7 to 10 pounds more to be at my healthiest weight but have been a little stuck for the last couple of months. My doctor is increasing dose to 2.25 which is still a little lower than the prescribed dose of 2.4 used  in the study. I am optimistic that will do the trick. I LOVE this medication.

I'm literally afraid to eat while taking this. The heartburn is like nothing I've ever experienced and now I'm on the 2.4 dose and have decided I am DONE.

I'm just starting my 14th week (2nd 1.7 dose) and have lost 26 lbs so far. My side effects thus far have been super mild compared to what I've read here; some mild nausea and constipation, but that's really it, and I guess I'm tired a bit, but I can't separate that from the rest of my normal life, stress, whatever. I haven't slept well in eons, so it is more likely related to adulting in general, and not med-related. I get nervous at every jump in strength, but so far, that hasn't been an issue either. I guess we'll find out when I jump to the maintenance dose. My biggest frustration has been with price (my insurance doesn't cover it) and accessibility, and my biggest fear is maintenance when I finally (if I ever) reach my goal weight. This obviously isn't sustainable forever (who can afford that?!) but I will appreciate the jumpstart it's given me, I guess regardless of where I net out down the road. Good luck all!"
Semaglutide,Wegovy,7/27/2022,Robert,45-54,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,4.0,4,4,4,1.0,0,"I have been on Wegovy for 2 months and have dropped 40 pounds. This is good, but it comes at a cost. The drug has totally changed my relationship with food. I always loved food. Every meal was an event I looked forward to, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. But due to childhood trauma (being starved as an infant), I always ate way too much. Sometimes 3 or 4 times what might be considered a normal portion. 

Since taking wegovy, I can't enjoy food at all anymore. Eating even a small amountmakes me feel ill. Swallowing itself causes pain. I've never vomited and the feeling passes eventually. But I no longer look forward to meals and sometimes I'll just skip eating altogether because I don't want to go through the hassle and pain.

I feel like the protagonist in Clockwork Orange. I've been conditioned by a drug to hate one of the things I've always loved most. It's the mental strain of this situation that has caused me the most stress. Far more than the nausea and pain of eating itself. 

But I need to accept it, or face weight related conditions like diabetes, heart attack and stroke. Living longer to see my grandchildren grow up outweighs my passion for food. So, I'll keep taking my shot. Unless they invent a pill that allows you to eat as much as you want and never gain weight."

Like many here, finding the correct dosage was a challenge, even resulting in delayed refills. I found the vomiting was worse after a delayed dose. I hope to be able to live with the nausea, fatigue and extreme vomiting long enough to lose at least another 80 lbs. I have found that the day of taking Wegovyand the next 3 days are the worst, but of course by then the next dose is around the corner. I have very little appetite, no taste for anything sweet, but crave anything salty. Salted pretzel sticks are my best friend."

In the beginning I got nauseated, headaches, and I've had severe hair loss.  Hair is growing back. My physician told me to take antacid for the nausea and that worked very well. I started in November 21 and by now the effect is slipping away. I have more hunger and cravings again. I am at a weight plateau for weeks now.

I had to stop taking the meds, see a gastro physician abx was diagnosed with gastroparesis.  The only way for my stomach to now empty properly is with the assistance of a neurotransmitter that has to be implanted into my stomach. I now livewith a lifelong condition thanks to this drug.

Most of my side effects are during the first few days of the injection. I have lost 10 lbs within the first month but then nothing so far since. I have considered stopping multiple times due to the side effects. I have random bouts of nausea but worse in the morning when first waking up and i take a few drinks of pickle juice and it goes away usually. Worse than the nausea for me is the intense fatigue. I nap daily and have no energy to exercise for the first few days after my injections. On the lower doses i was getting outside and exercising but it causes so bad fatigue and weakness it’s hard now. All in all for me, i don’t think losing 10 lbs has been worth giving up my entire summer being sick form this med and unable to enjoy stuff. Perhaps if i had a 30 or 40 lb loss that would be different. I plan to give it 2 more weeks and if i haven’t lost at least 8 lbs I’ll stop it."

So far I am down 26 pounds and have managed to loose weight weekly.  My appetite has definitely decreased tremendously, it really surprised me how quickly it worked.  Some of the side effects I have had are nausea, constipation, diarrhea and abdominal cramping.  The cramping is definitely uncomfortable but fortunately only happens to me about once a week.  I’ve also noticed if I eat certain foods 
(greasy foods mostly)  it can make thecramping worse. Overall  I eat pretty healthy and have no cravings for sweets or chocolate! I will eat it on occasion but do not get the same satisfaction from eating it as I did pre-wegovy.  It’s very important to drink a lot of fluids, on days I feel blah I will drink Gatorade or Powerade zero and that has really helped. I have also taken Zofran a handful
of times in the last 10 weeks. I’m very happy with the results and  each week it gets easier to tolerate.   I have no regrets and have recommended it to others and am very hopeful I will get to the max dose of 2.4.  as far as supply I have been lucky and  able to find it.

Semaglutide,Wegovy,6/11/2022,Hopeful,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,4.0,5,3,4,1.0,0,"I’m a 56 year old female, 5’11” and started out at 227 pounds. I have struggled with my weight since high school. Like many, I’ve had temporary weight loss successes, regaining everything and then some, each time. My realistic goal is to be 195lbs. My ideal goal is 180lbs. I have currently lost 23 lbs and have been on the program for approximately 6 weeks.
 I began the standard titration schedule in April 2022. Luckily, my insurance covers the medication!! Due to a pharmacy glitch, I only had one of the .25 doses before jumping to .5. The result was 3 miserable days of the gut wrenching vomiting described elsewhere in these reviews. I contacted Novo Nordisk to ask questions and report my experience and was told I would be receiving a call, which I never got.
My titration schedule since the week 2 glitch, has been smooth. I’ve chosen to have my Rx filled by a large mail-out pharmacy, reasoning that they will get inventory priority over my small town local pharmacy. So far I have not experienced the medication shortages suffered by others. 
I am currently one week in on the 1.7 dose. I have no intention of stopping the medication, but it is definitely not a walk in the park.
Intermittent nausea, deep fatigue, headaches, constipation, general feelings of yuckiness, plus  my initial bout with vomiting, have made this a difficult journey. Zofran is my friend. My goal is to stay on the medication for at least two months at the 2.4 dose, giving my body plenty of time to adjust.  My credo is that I would rather be sick for a little while than fat for the rest of my life. 
I have had no hair loss (an adverse effect  reported in these reviews but not in the Wegovy literature), nor have I had any other serious or life threatening side effects.
Like most, I have an extremely reduced appetite as well as a distinct change in the type of foods I find appealing. Like another reviewer, I can’t tolerate heavy greasy foods. Fresh and frozen fruit are my favorites. I have increased thirst and find myself guzzling ice water (I also happen to live in New Mexico which has literally been on fire for the past 6 weeks, contributing, I’m sure, to my feelings of being parched).
Overall, I’m extremely grateful to finally have a chance at real and lasting weight loss. My knees hurt less, my self image has improved, my clothes are more comfortable and less tent-like. Moving around is easier in general. I’m no longer embarrassed by how much food I consume. I’m still too ashamed to be seen in a bathing suit, but soon even that will be a possibility (I want to start swimming again). I have hope again."

Cycled through 0.25, .05 and 1.0 doses with no major issues. Started 1.7 dose just as I got COVID. Horrible side effects (almost ended up in the ER from dehydration) and could not tolerate the 1.7 dose so my PCP recommended I go back down to 0.5 and cycle through again until my body could handle the higher dose.

Just finished my time on 0.5 dose and now cannot get any 1.0 dose pens from my pharmacy. The drug manufacturer has no supply of 1.0. Apparently there is now a national shortage. They are saying they should have some in ""the second half of 2022"". Not sure what that means - June? December? Glad the manufacturer is being so transparent. My pharmacy told me to start calling around to see if anyone has any Wegovy and they will transfer my prescription. Who has time for that? 

Basically this drug manufacturer has left their customers high and dry. There was ZERO communication that there was a supply problem. I would not have cycled through doses a second time if I had known I was going to have to go off it again. I won't be waiting around for them to decide to actually supply the drug to consumers. I certainly will not be cycling through doses a second time.

For anyone who has not started Wegovy - don't bother. Since they cannot guarantee supply, I would not start down this road. You can't just stop, start and jump doses unless you want potentially severe side effects. 

Clearly this drug manufacturer does not care about the people using this medication since, ""Novo execs are pleased with Wegovy’s launch so far."" Not sure how they are pleased with a launch that leaves patients high and dry and having to discontinue use of the drug after MONTHS of stepping up doses. This drug costs me $1300+ per month so this is not something I take lightly, not to mention the health impacts. I feel I have wasted over $10,000 in drug costs. Glad Novo is ""pleased"" with that."

Started at .25 and am now on 1mg with no plans to increase as this is already incredibly wildly effective and I don't need it to be more effective. I am now in the 'normal' weight range per BMI chart for the first time since I was in my teens. I could not be more thrilled. Now my doctor and I are trying to figure out how to titrate back down the dosage and hopefully not re-gain the weight.

I'm looking to get back on the program but unfortunately, my insurance does not cover Wegovy.

Semaglutide,Wegovy,5/12/2022,Linds,25-34,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,4.0,4,4,4,1.0,0,"0.25: on this dosage for 4 weeks. Nausea the first few days after taking a dose, but not bad. Noticeably less hungry and less cravings. Slight fatigue. 

0.5: noticeably more fatigue and nausea. Still losing weight (down from 177 to 165 at this point). HORRIBLE diarrhea 3 days after 2nd dose- could be period related but omg I’ve never experienced that kind of pain before, which lasted about 12 hrs. 

1: I just took my second dose of 1mg. Not hungry at all. Fatigue not as bad this week. Nausea isalmost crippling, but I’m trying to stick it out. Down to 161lbs. 

Overall, for me, this med has been very effective as far as weight loss, but very difficult to enjoy normal life with the side effects. I will probably quit when I finish this pack. 

Also, it’s $860 per month with the discount from manufacturer, which is ridiculous."

My problem started just into my third month.  My hair start falling out in big clumps.  I am 7 months into stopping it and I had had to cut my hair short as I had so many lengths it looked awful.  I have been a stressful time.  I called the company to let them know of my hair loss and someone was supposed to call me back but never did.  I still do not see hair loss on the Wegovy site as a possible side effect.  I wish it would get put on as one just so people can make a decision as to if this is something they can live with.

I can’t abide anything greasy, spicy, or unhealthy, so that helps, too.  2) The side effects range from tough to terrible.  Fatigue, hair loss, constipation AND diarrhea, but the worst for me is the horrible nausea. I vomited every time I increased a dose and often for no apparent reason.  This is full-on, empty-your-entire-stomach-until-your-throat-is-scraped-raw-vomiting.  Yesterday I moved to 1.7 and have had constant vomiting and diarrhea.  I will be not taking another dose of 1.7 because despite the clear effects on my weight, I can’t let this drug ruin my life in this way!  I will see if I can go back to 1.0, since the nausea was intermittent and handled by Zofran at that level."

I took for 4 months and had no side effects until the 1.7 mg dose, but also sadly not much weight loss. My appetite was lessened, but I continually lost and gained within a 5 pound range.

The nausea was horrible and the stomach pain really bad.  Third day my husband dragged me to urgent care where I had severe dehydration.  After 4 hours of tests and 3 bags of fluid and anti-nausea drugs I was released to go home.  It's been a week since all that happened, and my stomach still is not 100%.  I'm going back to losing weight the old fashion way by smallerportions and daily walks.  I have issues with my thyroid and losing weight is very difficult, but I don't want to ever feel that awful again.  I'm glad others have had success, it's just not for me."

I have NEVER had weight issues. I started putting on weight in my mid 40's. I'm very active...I play softball a few times a week, crossfit (LOVE), 5k's and did bootcamp while doing crossfit. I'm NOT a big eater & I don't like fast food much. I eat decent but was told not enough. At lunch I always walked over a mile but I continued to ""BLOW UP""...literally! I found out I had Hashimoto disease which explained the bloating. Once Istarted my medicine for that my weight started to come off. Our drug rep came in one day with Wegovy. I asked my doctor in my office about it & was told I could try it. Me and some of the nurses started taking it. The side effects weren't to bad at first. The 3rd & 4th month was HORRIBLE! I was having IBS attacks...vomiting & #2 at the same time, tired, burping more. If I ate something...which wasn't much...if I sat down to watch tv I started feeling like I was bloating up, like I had to burp. Once I stood up I would burp & I could immediately feel the bloating going down. Then I would have attacks if I drank my protein shakes. Then I had attacks if I drank milk. I tried Almond milk & I had attacks....so I stopped drinking any form of milk. I was told by the drug rep that Wegovy doesn't do well with people that doesn't have a gallbladder...which I don't. I have lost over 20pds but I'm sure my thyroid medicine helped with that as well. I noticed since taking Wegovy I have lost some of my muscle mass which for EVERYONE is not good. You want your fat mass to go down & your muscle mass to go up. As I'm reading some of these reviews, I'm reading that some are losing a lot fast. That isn't good & it is probably muscle mass, not a lot of fat mass. 
Another side effect for me and another coworker was gag reflex. I was brushing my teeth & then tongue and I literally vomited!! NASTY!! I took my last shot this week & I'm done. I'm glad it has helped some people BUT remember to consume 85 plus grams of protein & more if you are exercising more. Drink a lot of water and do weight training!!"

Since I was a kid I have always been a hungry person and never able to go more than a few hours without eating. I typically compensated for years by extreme exercise.  After combining Covid isolation plus menopause I was obese and not feeling good. Wegovy combined with a low carb diet and exercise has made the pounds continue to fall off. I can now eat literally half or less of what I would eat normally with no stress. My brain really just tellsme now that’s enough. Thankful for science and this great advancement for weight loss!

I just started my 2nd round (5th week) still at .25, and already lost 11 lbs. Although I’ve lost weight, I’m not going to sugar coat the side effects.  For me it’s the  sudden nausea with bloating, constipation and fatigue.  By now, I’m learning to manage by using OTC nausea medication and stool softener. Sometimes I want to stop using it because of the symptoms, but seeing the lbs come off keeps me going.  The medication really does curb your appetite dramatically.  I don’t feel hungry at all.  Every patient will react differently but you won’t know until you try it.  I can’t see myself increasing the dosage right now.  I don’t think I can handle a higher dose."

I have a sensitive stomach so I am not surprised I experienced every side effect. I did not have any issues with .25 or .5.

Started Wegovy mid- October 2021, I’ve lost 49lbs as of today. It’s truly been a miracle for me, my appetite is very small and I get fuller, faster, which is the whole concept of this hormone. My doctor and I have decided to stay at 1.7 since I’m doing so well, that way we have a backup. This past month I will say I feel like I need to titrate up, as I don’t seem to be getting full and I’m starting to think about food more. I would like to know if anyone else has noticed a decline in effectiveness. I’m still happy, plan on taking it forever if needed, with my success, it’s clear my body was depleted of this hormone. The majority of my weight came off in the first couple of months, now I’m steady, losing a pound or two occasionally, I’d be happy here, although my goal is to be 11lbs lighter. Stick with it, I had nausea up to 1.7, now it’s non-existent. Keep a bag of saltines with you, have a couple when you experience it. Highly recommend this drug."

Have lost weight and I am going to stick with it.  But after I went up to the 2.4 I started experiencing sensitive skin on my arms, legs and back.  It felt like sunburn but there was no rash, no redness.  It was very weird!  At times it was severe, especially on my back.  I actually went to my doctor thinking I had shingles.  But it has for the most part gone away.  I am still having just a small amount of sensitivity in the skin on my back.  My sister started Wegovy after me and started having the same sensitivity in her skin.  That's when we realized it must be from the Wegovy.  I have noticed my hair is dry feeling.

I am on the full maintenance dose and the weight loss seems to be leveling off.  I have not tried to lose weigh--it has just happened due to decreased appetite.  Finally something that works!  I have always had a big appetite and after menopause it really became a problem.  It seems incredible to me now that I'm not needing to eat as much.  I avoid junk foods but still have a strong sweet tooth and indulge in sweets fairly regularly.  In have had constipation, some low level nausea, some fatigue, and tingling skin at times, but not to the point of stopping Wegovy.  These side effects are mostly felt on day 2 and 3 following the injection.  By week's end they are typically gone.  Side effects also occurred when moving up to the next dose level.  But after a week at the new level the side effects dimished each time.  I lingered at .5 for two months rather than going to the next level and did the same spending two months on 1.7 because I didn't want to deal with the side effects.  Once I took the plunge and made it to 2.4, I was glad I went for it.  The first few days at 2.4 were rough but I'm okay now.  I'm about to begin my second month on the maintenance dose and am hopeful that the weight loss will continue.  I think it will because I am just not craving all the calories.  My doctor provided me a Rx for nausea, which I have only used a few times.  Also, I have continued on 10 mg of Omeprazole for acid reflux that I had taken for 5 years prior, and I did not need to increase it once I started Wegovy. I also take thyroid medication without incident.   The weight loss has really helped my arthritus knee pain,  and I feel that has been worth the trade-offs .  My doctor is pleased that the weight is coming off slowly because, she says, it is more likely to stay off that way.  I am concerned that if/when I stop taking Wegovy my appetite will return along with the weight.   But for now I am very pleased with the progress and I have no plan to stop anytime soon."

Wegovy caused me to become hyperthyroid.  I was losing my hair, I was always cold and could not sleep at night. I’m not sure that losing 25 pounds was worth using Wegovy. I never made it past .50 The nausea stomach cramps and constipation were morethan I wanted to deal with. It is April 2022 and I have lost a lot of hair and my hair became very brittle and is breaking off. I do not recommend this for anyone taking thyroid medication.

I am titrating up monthly and just took my last .5 before starting 1.0 next week. As of today (4/4/2022) I weigh 315. So almost 30 pounds in 2 months. Diet is mid-keto. Keeping carbs below 35g/day and protein above 80g/day. Have not incorporated exercise into my routine yet. I try to drink around 100+ ounces of water a day. So far no side effects on either the .25 or .50 doses other than fatigue and being constantly cold. But at 55 years of age and going through menopause, I welcome the cold. I am nervous about the higher doses, but I cannot let it bother me. I put off taking my first Wegovy injection due to fear of side effects - and that was a mistake since I haven't really had any so far. Slow and steady is best. My Doc says that anything lost on the lower doses is a bonus as most people see their best weight loss on 1.7 and 2.4 doses. Good Luck to everyone on their journey."

I started at 178 lbs and currently at 157 lbs. So I'm averaging about a lb a week. Some weeks I don't lose any weight but then the next week may lose 2-3 lbs.  I have not had any serious side effects.  Occasional nausea 1st few months but  would only lasted a few hrs. Occasional stomach cramping. I have found that when I experience these side effects it is due to forgetting to eat, eating something I shouldn't (ie: fatty or highsugar foods), or eating to much at one time.  Be sure to drink plenty of water.  I have had mild constipation issues since having my gallbladder removed just over a yr ago, so I have to occasionally take a stool softener but Wegovy hasn't seem to make it any worse. I have cervical stenosis and was having severe low back spasms. I also have some arthritis in hands and feet so I needed to get some weight off my small frame of 5'4"".  So far I'm happy with Wegovy.  I recommend not restricting your calorie intake to extremely and not trying to losing more than 1-2 lbs per week on avg (unless doctor advises otherwise). Remember to eat something every few hrs and drink plenty of water. Don't let yourself get too hungry and then eat too much, that will lead to discomfort."

I tried everything...exercise, intermittent fasting, keto, clean eating, more protein less carbs, HCG, WW, etc etc etc and the weight would not budge.  I am working with a nutritionist in my Dr's office and started a month ago at a very low dose of .25.  I am eating half of what I usually eat and have no cravings for sweets, wine or bad food.  I am down 11 lbs in 1 month and I feel hopeful for the first time in a long time!  I am less bloated and down a size.  I have nausea at times but nothing unbearable.  It basically slows your digestion down so I take something each day to help with bowel movements.  I take pepcid each day to prevent any reflux.  My injection also has B12 in it and I think it helps.  I also take a B12 shot on its own about 3 days after my Samgulitide shot.  I should also say I started bio identical hormone therapy around the same time and I think it has helped me a lot at least with the hot flashes!  I feel like my metabolism is kicking it up a notch finally!  If you can work with a reputable medical professional who has experience administering this medication, I recommend it!  I meet with mine each week and she monitors me very closely.  Dosage is key and it sounds like a lot of people start to high for some reason and that creates complications.

I also get bad acid reflux for those first 3 days after taking the injection.  It does help with my appetite but I struggle to have the energy to exercise.  AlthoughI will force myself to do exercise, it is not enjoyable (as it once was).  I have not had any stomach issues with the dose I have taken thus far.  And... after reading some of these other posts on here, I am nervous to up my dose for fear of severe nausea!  I really need to lose at least 30 more pounds for a knee surgery.

I am carefully following a low calorie diet and exercising.  Not sure I am going to continue with this medication. I easily could have lost those 3 pounds the second month without this medication.  The side effects are no joke.  I am exhausted so much of the time (many days I need to nap) and have frequent GI upset, although no significant nauseau and no vomitting like others have reported. Frankly, I am really disappointed.  My doctor told me to expect to lose 8 pounds per month and that the side effects are transient and that is definitely not what is happening.  On the plus side, it is very easy to administer.  I can't imagine someone having trouble with it and I was initially nervous about self-injections.

I lost 20 pounds in the first two months, none the 3rd month, 2 lbs the 4th month, and 6 lbs the 5th month for a total of 28 lbs.  I have lumbar spinal stenosis, so exercise is difficult for me, but I do water walking 2-3 times per week and just started strength training twice a week.  The injections are super easy; soooo much better than a daily pill.  I wish the injector pens could be sanitized and reused instead of thrown away.  I have a hatial hernia and severe GERD.  Wegovy makes this much much worse, especially when I’m trying to sleep.  With the coupon, I pay about $1200/month as this drug is NOT covered by Anthem.  I’m a bit disappointed that I have not lost more, especially since I can eat very little without starting to feel some minor nausea. I am prediabetic, and my A1C has gone from 5.8 to 5.6.

Started out 183 pounds.  I have been on it 6 months and have lost 40 pounds! I  55 and have tried every diet out there with no results.The nausea is horrible for about 36 hours after my injection,  but eases up considerably.  I have been a little tired after each injection, but I thought I was just being lazy. Didn't realize that was a side effect. My main side effect is hair loss. I got COVID the 1st week of January and heard horrorstories of hair loss after COVID. I have noticed hair in the drain after I wash my hair and when I run my fingers through my hair. I did not realize hair loss could also be a side effect with Wegovy.  Not sure if the hair loss is from Wegovy or COVID. Seeing lots of baby hairs coming in, thank God.Overall, I really am impressed with my weight loss results with Wegovy.  Once I realized the nausea is not constant and goes away after a few days, I knew I could tolerate it. Hubby says I "" eat like a bird"". Feel full after a few bites. Learned quickly not to drink a lot of fluids and then eat. You will vomit. I learned to adjust my fluid intake around my meals. I recommended Wegovy to my sister and she is starting it soon. Interested to see how her journey on Wegovy will go. Very impressed with Wegovy and definitely recommend it for weight loss."

When I stopped taking the medicine the pain was gone, but weight began to creep back even after maintaining the exact same amount of calories and exercise. Not sure how the medicine affected that drastic loss of weight but I did my part and at least I have better eating habits.

The injection is truly painless and easy. Occasionally I will feel slightly nauseous but that is always because I didn’t listen to the cues my body is sending that I need to stop eating. It is hard to re-learn how you eat and listen to what your body is telling you, but if you do, you should feel fine. This medicine is a tool not a cure-all.

Also I have absolutely NO appetite whatsoever.  I am struggling to force myself to eat, and even when I do, I am absolutely done in 2-3 bites.  I have also noticed a serious decrease in energy and overall mood- not sure if this is from not eating orthe drug itself.  But the side effects are well worth the results, for me at least.  As far as supply, there are occasional issues with getting it filled.  But I recently read the manufacturer is shut down temporarily due to safety regulations- and from what they are saying, the lower doses will be the only ones affected, and could be off the shelves for up to 6 months.

Had no appetite some nausea not awful. Lost 15 pounds.
Then at the 1.7 dose the bigger problems began. 
Super nausea omg I felt so ill I stayed in bed. Couldnt even talk I felt so sick. Also started to give me more muscle spasms ( I have fibromyalgia from Lyme Disease). They were nonstop and horrific. More anxiety,  could not poop at all. When I forced it and took every laxative it was so painful I wanted someone to shoot me dead.
Also..sweating. ugh.
Just awful. So I backed it down to the .5. Made it 4 weeks and after I had more anxiety again and more depression and freaked out ith a major panic attack I'm quitting forever. I don't know if it built up in my body and then caused the problems mixed with my other health conditions or what but this drug is not sustainable. I also vomited terribly on the 1.7 at 3am.
It has the most side effects with any medication I've ever tried. They were delayed, but then I got super slammed. I had to increase my anxiety med because of this.  I hope I feel better in a month. I'm disabled and don't work. I'd never be able to work while taking this drug. I'm glad some can continue.

Semaglutide,Wegovy,3/17/2022,Jessica,35-44,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,4.0,4,5,3,1.0,0,"I started Wegovy 4.5 months ago and have lost 10 pounds.  I am currently on the 1.7mg dose and upping to the 2.4mg dose next week. I personally get extremely nauseous and fatigued for the first 2-3 days post injection.  The medication absolutely decreases my appetite, I get full very quickly and stay full for a long time.  I often feel quite nauseous about 20-30 mins after eating for about an hour and then it goes away.  I  read a lot of reviews that show I much greater amount of weight loss ina shorter amount of time than I have achieved and I have felt frustrated at time by that, however, the clinical trial data shows an 15% weight loss over 68 weeks, which is 17 months.  Therefore, I think my “slower” weight loss is ok and I do find the medication effective.  I am also on an SSRI for depression maintenance, which increases my appetite significantly and perhaps slows down some of the weight loss.  Before every injection, I debate if I want to stop the medication or continue it because I feel so sick the first few days, but it’s is working and I’d like to get more weight off before I stop.  In a nut shell: don’t get too frustrated if the weight is not flying off.  Watch your diet, exercise and keep going as long as you can tolerate the med."

I moved up to .5mg after the third dose of .25 and I’ll probably do the same as I titrate up to 1.0 because I’ve not had any nausea-related side effects thus far. It’s a really great drug for me. Ive tried diet and exercise several times over the years and that program worked but it was SO hard to keep it up for several months at a time and the hunger pains never went away. That’s the best thing about this drug - no hunger pains. At all. Zero. The only two things that I’ve noticed is my sleep habits became a little worse. I had trouble sleeping more than a maximum of 6 hrs / night but I started taking melatonin and that’s helped tremendously and I’m back to normal sleep. The other is a little constipation. Prior to the drug I was routine once/day, now it’s once every 3-4 days. But I eat so little now that it’s not really an issue. Aside from that I’ve had a very good experience on this drug. Nothing tastes different or worse - I just eat 1/8 to 1/10 of what I used to consume. When I eat too much, which was hard to gauge the first few weeks, I felt like I had the biggest meal of my life, which was uncomfortable, but it went away after an hour or two. You need to learn how much food is enough, which is much less than you think it is. One trick I’ve used is to try to eat very slowly."

Zero constipation due to exercise and eating a cup of bran-type cereal each day.

I do feel tired a lot, mainly from not eating much, so keeping a food diary helps me up my food intake when it’s too low.

I started to have intolerable side effects at the 1.7 dose and after 6 weeks had to. Drop it to .5 again.
I have fibromyalgia from Lyme disease and it gave me unbelievable fibro flares. Maybe something to do with the sugars in the muscles. I screamed in pain. Also couldn't eat much at all, was so constipated I would take anything and everything to try and go and only could after 7 hours of lying in the bathroom in the worst pain imaginable.
Woke up at 3am twice and vomited also.
I also see a difference in the texture of my hair. Very dry. Makes sense if my whole system is dry.
So I'm using the .5 maybe 2x month but I think I'm going off it. I just got my hair back and I don't want to lose it again.
I don't know how many can tolerate the side effects at the higher doses. I was so nauseous I felt like death.
I'll try my best to keep the weight off.
Maybe a low bimonthly dose will help me do that. I am 53 years old. The website wouldn't let me record my real age.

I exercise a lot, but haven't changed what I eat much. The pros... I can feel starving, then be full after eating very little. I'm losing weight pretty consistently. I can still eat things like sushi, ice cream etc, but instead of eating a bunch, a few bites and I feel satisfied. Food I used to love I no longer have any craving for. I have also noticed that even drinking (in a margarita fan) has lost a lot of its allure. I amlooking great and about to break the 150 mark for the first time in a decade.

Cons... I feel generally unwell. Like I am coming down with something. It wasn't terrible at first, but as the dose increases, it gets pretty bad. I am on a generic semaglutide so thank God, the prescriber has been able to titrate me insanely slow (often by .25 every week or two) but we had to lower it back again as I seriously was miserable. Since getting to around 1.7, I am having a lot of problems with constipation, way more nausea (like waking at 4am and running to the bathroom to vomit), heartburn, and lots of burping which randomly started this week and really sucks. I exercise about 6 days a week and went from level 8-10 on the elliptical to feeling like I'm going to pass out of I go higher than about level 2. A flight of stairs kicks my butt. I get dizzy super easy. Most of this slowly started around 1mg, but the 1.7 has been brutal. I told the prescriber I don't think I can go higher than this and she seems amenable. So I imagine the weight loss will slow down but it would be nice to find a balance of still maintaining/losing a bit while also feeling well."

Ive been on it since 12-8-21. Its been almost 3 months & I'm down 30lbs. I dont crave foods anymore since I'm on my 3rd box (dosage goes up every month). Sometimes I feel like I'm starving but when I start 2 eat I can only take a few bites. My issue is constipation. Exercise, drinking nothing but water, coffee, taking  laxatives, prune juice, fiber supplements, probiotics, & enema didn't work & now I'm having 2 see a gastrologist. Its a rough drug but worth it if your obese & need 2 lose the weight fast. My 18 yr old son is on it. He was 240lbs. Hes lost 20lbs in 2 months. His only issue is an upset stomach but he likes it."

My side effects have been pretty mild. I think I had nausea/stomach pain the first few weeks after I started. Now for the most part I only have nausea in the few days after I've titrated up. I did have one week where I started puking and had really bad nausea. It turned out I'd forgotten to take my dose the week before. I'm writing the date I'm supposed to take each on the shots right when I get a new box now. My appetite has been reduced significantly. Some days I can eat normal amounts of food, but others I just don't get hungry or get full very quickly. I am very aware of when I'm full now, like I'll eat half of my food and then feel like I don't want another bite. If for some reason I do eat past that point I can get nauseous and my stomach might start hurting, but that's rare for me. Also the shots themselves aren't that bad. I do Emgality shots once a month and those hurt a lot more than the Wegovy. My weight loss has been really steady. I don't think I'm done losing weight and the weight loss has been pretty unrelated to my exercise/types of food I eat. I've been stressed and have not been making good decisions in those areas. I'll probably stay on this for the rest of my life if I can. As far as the cost, I get it for $25 with the coupon for now. I was told it would be $100 a month without the coupon. I luckily just got a better job, so I'm just going to pay the $100 a month once the coupon runs out. Hopefully insurances will start covering it more and make it more accessible."

Since starting Wegovy I have lost an additional 35 pounds but with absolutely no food cravings or obsession. It was embarrassingly easy to lose weight on Wegovy. No nausea. I have classic symptoms of weight loss: 1) some fatigue initially when I was losing weight quickly, which has now resolved; 2) cold intolerance has been my most discomforting side effect; 3) bowel movements only once every 5-7 days but without any symptoms of constipation. Nearing a plateau in my weight with only 2 pounds weight loss in the last month and BMI 24. I could not be more pleased and feel blessed that I have excellent insurance with virtually no co-pay.

But I will be using my third injection in 2 days and am all in. Let me make a list of what I experienced on this med. 
From Day 2 
I did not Crave food. I did not think about my next meal
I did not feel the hunger one feels when they are obese. You know what I mean
I have gone every morning but two without breakfast. Yes I know its the most important meal. But its also a chance for your body to start burning fat. I dont care what nutritionist say it worked for me in the past. And if I can only have coffee until 1130a I am doing this.
So lets see how this goes"

I have lost 65 lbs since August 1, 2021 with minimal side effects. My favorite part of taking Wegovy is that it has changed the way I think about food. For me, the challenge and struggle in losing weight is that I constantly thought about what I was or wasn't eating. Wegovy has changed that. I rarely have cravings. If I do, a small bite of something satisfies the craving. Thankfully, my insurance has approved it through Aug 2022. Hopefully, I will be able toget it for my cost of $25/month after then. I hope that insurance agencies will see the value in approving weight loss medication for prevention of comorbidities of obesity."

Sure it works, anyone would lose weight if they’re constantly sick. It’s like a forced eating disorder because if you eat more than a few bites you’ll vomit and then eventually you lose your appetite completely. Constantly nausea for 4 months  will do that to you. It did solve a problem for me in getting a large amount of weight off, 40 lbs in 4 months to be exact. Due to a health issue (diagnosis of RA) I suddenly gained a lot of weight and couldn’t getit back off. I’m not sure that this would work for someone who’s been overweight for an extended period of time for the sheer fact that you don’t learn any healthy habits so I’m not sure how you would maintain it once discontinuing Wegovy. I’m not even sure i won’t gain it back for the same reason. Not eating is not healthy, vomiting every week is not healthy and is it really safe to mess with your blood sugar and pancreas? I’m grateful for getting this head start and hope that I can now move to (my own) phase two and work with a nutritionist because I just can’t do it anymore. Bottom line it may have some benefits for some people but there are a lot of side effects so proceed with caution. Words just could not express how incredibly sick I have been since starting this! I started at the lowest dose and got to the maximum 2.4 at 4 months."

I am now on 1.7 and contemplating stopping the medication. It’s time to increase to 2.4 but I told my doctor there’s no way and she gave me another prescription for 1.7. She also provided an anti-nausea medication that helps just a little.  Very torn because I want to keep losing but I also want to stop feeling sick every single day. My husband thinks this is ridiculous and I should stop because he is tired of me being sick.  In my third month I also started experiencing headaches and they continue. This last month I am experiencing severe muscle cramps in my back where nothing seems to relieve it. Thank goodness it’s only happened a few days here and there.

It was scary. 
So I will come down on the wegovy.
I was ok until the 1.7.
Side effects are TIRED!
NAUSEA REALLY BAD. BURPING CONSTIPATION. I CRIED I felt so ill. I'll go down to the low dose and lose 1 or 2 pounds a month. Fine. No more highdose.
Taking a 3 week break right night.
Maybe I'll go to the bathroom. Also people...if you lose weight too fast your hair will cone out. Careful. I list 16 pounds in 4 months and I'm worried because I just regrew my hair from my illness. Be careful. Tirate SLOWLY

I notice the most side effects when I up my dosage (at 1.7 currently) but by the end of the 4 shots I notice less and less. 

I get very tired initially and the mild headache along with acid reflex can be annoying but the results have been worth it. I feel less interested in eating, even if my favorite food is around I’m just not getting the same satisfaction from it that I did in the past. 

I haven’t been great about exercising but I’ve still been losing 2-3 (sometimes more) lbs a week. I’m definitely an advocate for this shot if other procedures and plans haven’t worked for you."

I now have very thin hair on top with bald spots. Of course I stopped the medication right away. Now the depression of not having the halo to take the weight off I also Hate my hair. I think it looks awful. I had to cut it just to make it presentable. Wegovy for weight loss was great but there can be hair loss. I called the company to let them know. The lady said she was going to have someone call me about my results and no one ever did. Just know hair loss is a possible side effect.  Wish I’d hadn’t been for me.

Up until this point I was nauseous, gassy and had diarrhea immediately after I ate, but I didn't mind all that because I could tell it was working. And the fact that I had already lost 20lbs in 2 mos was awesome. I had no cravings, the smell of food made me ill, no appetite -it was great. But now that I've started 1 mg, none of those side effects are happening, I'm back to craving food and I'm back to being able to eat food without getting rid of it right away (diarrhea). So now I'm worried that the 1 mg dose isn't working. It was the .5 mgs where I lost the most weight but was the sickest. Do I need to go back down to .5? Should I just keep going? Not sure what to do but this drug is amazing and I would highly recommend. Not everybody will experience the same side effects, so don't let that keep you from trying it.

Semaglutide,Wegovy,12/21/2021,Anonymous,35-44,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,I'm on my 4th month of treatment (one more week left) and have made it to the 1.7mg dose. Early on i started noticing constipation but that was an easy fix. Just making sure I eat more fiber and using a stool softener. There would be a few times I felt nauseous but i wasn't eating like i should have. Just trying to learn what my body needed. That went away with some adjustments to snacking and eating. This new dose however has been the hardest for me. The nausea is lingering. There have been a few times that I actually throw up. The nausea usually lasts the first two days of the weekly shot. If I take a nausea pill though it really helps. I notice that I feel full all day long some days. I try to eat something small just knowing that I still need to eat. I don't have any cravings. I've lost around 30 pounds. It started slowly at first but has really increased over the last 4 weeks. I've noticed that many of my clothes are fitting better. With more exercise I think my results will be even better. If you can find ways to manage any negative side affects I think its worth it to stick it out.
Semaglutide,Wegovy,12/21/2021,TO SAVE A LIFE,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Weight Loss Management for Overweight Person with BMI 27 to 29 and Weight-Related Comorbidity,5.0,5,5,5,1.0,0,I started this journey July 9th as a last resort to get healthy enough to come off of blood pressure medicine.  My brother is my best friend and is in need of a kidney transplant. His time if running short.  I am his only full blooded sibling. I went to Tampa to find out how to test to see if I was a match. I was turned away due to being under the age of 50 and on blood pressure meds which make me high risk for kidney problems in the future.  I was told I need to be off blood pressure meds at least 90 days before they will even test me to see if I am in fact a match.  I was devastated. When I returned home I spoke to my cardiologist and he told me to limit salt and lets try to lose some weight and he will monitor my blood pressure and see what we can do to come off the meds.  I went the very next day to a weight loss doctor and discussed options.  We determined that due to the nature of medical needs surrounding my need for regaining my health we would go with the wegovy.  As of December 20th I am down 34lb and about 8 inches off my waist.  I have been monitoring my blood pressure and taking half the medicine strength now from what I was on.  My blood pressure sometimes runs a little low/normal so we are thinking within another month or so I will be able to go without it and see how I do.  If everything goes well I hope to be able to enroll in testing to see if I am a match to donate a kidney for my brother.  If I am a match then we owe it to wegovy for saving two lives not just one.  That is a blessing for sure.  Fingers crossed and prayers raised.

I have lost 20% of my body weight in 5 months.  I am at my goal and it feels wonderful. However, I have had several awful GI episodes in this last month.  At first I just had mild nausea and great appetite suppression, but the last month I have bad nausea/pain episodes about once a week.  Its bad enough that I am stopping the wegovy, even though I am terrified of gaining weight back.  Still, I feel this medication is worth a try by anyone who is overweight or obese."

A little blah and had to take extra Pepcid for unset stomach. First day was amusing. Stomach gurgled nonstop all day. That night a little nauseous. Totally shut down my desire to eat. Certain food taste different. Sweet thing tend to taste overly sweet. Feeling full much sooner and can’t get through a full meal.  This is certainly the strangest drug I've ever taken. I’m hoping for the best. The doctor said she has had no one drop out. I think most of us will do anything toloose weight and as we have powered through all the side effects of being overweight, we will power through the Wegovy side effects. Good luck everybody."

I’m not sure that I will be able to continue taking this medication. While my cravings have been diminished significantly, I simply cannot eat without extreme nausea even with an anti-nausea medication. Within an hour of the shot, my arm and neck on the side I had the shot felt like they were sunburnt. Within 4 hours, I was vomiting more violently than I did while pregnant. I’ve never been this I’ll feeling since the time I had food poisoning and ended uphospitalized. The nausea is pervasive and will not go away even after vomiting and zofran. I’ve lost 7 pounds in 48 hours. Feel like I’m drying up. Smells trigger the nausea, even on day 3. It’s also given me some severe headaches that begin in the evenings and continue for many hours until I managed to fall asleep. I have nasty sulphuric burps and the gas and bloating are pretty bad too. Just started with diarrhea this morning. Not sure what it did to my system, but I’m not sure that I want to see what a higher dose does to my body. I doubt that I will continue this medication beyond the second dose unless my side effects improve dramatically."

I continued using this in hopes that I would start to see some kind of change. Unfortunelty no change in my weight what so ever. All it really did for me was give me a weekly two day long headache.

The only bad thing is that I stay nauseous all the time, and the next 2 days after taking the injection, I would throw up, even if I haven't ate anything, I would throw up the wegovy medicine I think, because it would be yellowish stuff coming up, and it has a weird taste. But on the 3rd day, and after, I just be nauseous, and I can't really eat anything, and if I eat to much, I would throw it up.

I started the highest level of Wegovy 10 days ago - 2.4 mg.  I almost immediately developed a skin sensitivity on my back.  Not itchy, no rash but just felt like I had a sunburn.  Honestly, I thought it was the starch in the shirt I had on.  It has remained for the past 10 days.  A few days after that started, I noticed that I had no hair on my legs - none at all.  None on my arms or underarms.  Honestly, I cannot pinpoint the day I noticed this development, but it was definitely noticeable after I hit the highest dosage.  I was freaked out - super concerned I would lose the hair on my head which at the moment, does not look any thinner.  I just got back from a dermatologist this morning and brought all the prescriptions I take.  When I pulled out the Wegovy box, he exclaimed, ""that is so interesting.  I got two calls from PCPs last week that said their patients on Wegovy had small bald spots on their scalp.""  He didn't know what dosage they were on.  He said he is going to contact the manufacturer to report these reported side effects.  He looked at my legs under a special magnifying glass.   He said that the hair follicles were not scarred - the hair was visible but not above the surface.  This would seem to indicate it will grow back.  He looked at my scalp and said it was healthy so, not thinning at the moment.  JUST A WARNING TO ALL."

No more sweets, chocolates, etc.  I seriously had an addiction to chocolate kisses and now justthe sight of them makes me slightly nauseous.

I have lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks with a combination of Wegovy, exercise, and a 1200 cal/day diet. I've noticed that Wegovy has curbed my appetite BIG TIME which is helpful since I've cut my intake in half. 
Some negative side effects I've been experiencing are:
1. constipation
2. headache
3. slight hair loss (this may be more from the reduced cal diet vs Wegovy)
I feel good though and I can't wait to give an update in a month or two!"

Yes it has been difficulty to get the dose of medication from pharmacies when you need it but my pharmacist has been great about looking around and getting it to me in time for increase. However when i increased to 1mg my body could not handle it , I became nervous on the inside and not eating hardly any food. The taste of most foods I love and have been eating  for years no longer taste the same therefore I don't have a taste for anything so my provider switch me back down to the 0.5 and I'm am doing great.

I spent one month at .25 and two at .5. Moving up to 1mg next week. Did experience bad nausea for a while, so my Dr prescribed Zofran and I take one pill before the injection and I don’t have any issues now. Definitely cuts my hunger/cravings way down. I focus on eating clean/lean proteins, fruit/veg, dairy (Greek yogurt) and very few grains. I’m diligent about checking labels and learned early on not to cheat. This medication will let you know fast if it doesn’t like something you ate and you won’t forget.  Been working with a Dietitian and she really helped me with making smart food choices. Exercising one day a week with a trainer and hoping to increase that soon. Weighing myself daily which has really helped.  I can tell how my body responds to any new foods this way. I first tried getting the medication at CVS and Walgreens and they weren’t able to get it. My local CVS still can’t (asked them recently). I use an independent local pharmacy now and they have no issues getting it. Go figure. Briefly used the coupon code, which was great, but my insurance has authorized paying for it, so that’s even easier.  If you are committed to eating properly/exercising I would definitely recommend Wegovy."

I have lost 7lbs and 30 inches all over. This has definitely cut back my appetite and sometimes I have to remind myself to eat. I am also eating much less at meals so I made up snack boxes this week to make sure I eat a healthy snack that is low calorie. The only problem I have found is eggs taste and smell funny to me. I have asked my family if they noticed eggs tasting funny and they said no so I know it's me with this medication. I also noticed that thesmell I get with eggs is now stuck in my nose. It's like a sulfur smell. Overall this medication is working and very easy to use. I do the injection in my thighs just switch each week.

Hunger diminished, exercising regularly, riding my bike daily.  Week 5 I started .5 and that's where this story unfortunately will end.   I cannot explain how sick I am.    I've had a hiatal hernia which is dormant for 20 or more years, I take nexium daily.   It's I describable how sick I've been.   Vomiting, diarrhea, sulphur burps, queasy stomach, feels like a brick is on my sternum.    Cannot lie down, burning bile backs up.   Today would have been my sixth shot, second st.5.  Instead of taking it, I'm googling how long it will take for this stuff to leave my system.    My diet is very low calorie, 500 or under, with that and exercise, I lost 11 lbs over five weeks.  After the horrific reaction, three lbs more came off but that's because of artificial weight loss although I would have lost a bet if I'd have bet no human being can expell that much material in one day.  I've never been this sick.  E VER.   So I'm going to stop now because I think the lesson is beware if you have a hiatal hernia.   It definitely was effective but I know it had very bad consequences for me. Nothing helped.   I found myself searching my cabinets for leftover Zantac, that's how much I just wanted to disappear.    Cannot lie down, aches everywhere.   Bye bye for me"

I have been eating low calorie since then which has been easy to do because my appetite has decreased dramatically! I am super surprised because today I am down 5.4lbs! The only side effect so far is very mild nausea which comes and goes but is very manageable. I would definitely recommend this medication for weight loss! I also want to add that I have struggled with PCOS for years which has made weight loss very difficult.

However I had gastric bypass a few years back so my stomach is always off. Yet this didn’t make it any worse. Has taken urges away to snack and really simply eat. I don’t feel terribly full yet could be because I have a small stomach to begin with and I eat small meals to begin with. First week only threw up once. Second week no issues and now into my third week. I am disappointed in the weight loss so far in 18days only lost 4.4 pounds and that is eating average 600 calories per day, keeping carbs under 80 per day and working out 3-4x per week. I was truly hoping for a jump in my weight loss.  I feel ready to move onto 1.0 after my 4th shot.  the shot itself I don’t even feel it I jsur feel the pressure of the pen kn my thigh which I recommend upper thigh. as for the benefits I cannot see. I am barely pre diabetic 5.7 A1c and this medicine hasn’t caused me to have low blood sugar that I can tell, even with keeping to under 80g carbs per say. So I hope this is helping my pancreas and getting me out of the ore diabetic zone for good. My insurance doesn’t cover and I have the discount savings card from Novo for six months which I understand they stopped for anyone new after 8-16 but I am able to get 5 more month supplies. There is a shortage and I had to call around and luckily found a pharmacy a bit far to fill my 1.0 box. More to follow when i move onto 1.0"

I have lost about 7 lbs and quite happy with those results. The first day of injection has been the worse for me accompanied with an annoying headache. I sometimes felt mild acid reflux and nausea that I normally calm with a soda and crackers. I endure dry mouth along with an irritating bitter or nasty taste in my mouth. Other times, I just feel off kilter and can't identify a specific symptom. But I am really concerned about my fatigue which I feltmore the second week.  I noticed only a few people mentioned that side affect. My appetite has largely diminished. (Actually, the joy of craving a particular food and satisfying that craving is done). When I do, eat pretty much anything will do. With busy 12 hour work days, I often don't eat at all. I conclude that may be attributing to the lethargy. I have succumbed to drinking pedialyte regularly and intend on drinking more water. I am getting through the day OK but can't wait to lie down when I get home (unusual for me). A few co-workers have commented on my lack of energy and luster, so to speak.  Perhaps Week 3 will be better.  I'm fighting to endure the ""cons"" for the desired result.  I get married in November and would love to be about 30-40 lbs lighter for the wedding. If I happen to reach that goal, I will probably refrain from taking it and work hard to keep the weight off."

So far I’ve lost 11 lbs with no exercise. The needle is very small and I can hardly feel it. I’m injecting into my thigh. Pros: I’m not hungry at all so I have to force myself to eat. When I do eat I eat very little. Cons: I get really nauseated especially on day of injection and day after. The other days are more tolerable. Every now and then I experience some heartburn which subsides with over the counter meds. All in all the drug is working! I can deal with the minor side effects as long as I’m getting great results. Im eating a lot less and losing weight as a result. I will try to incorporate exercise this week to speed up the weight loss. ??

The only side effects I have noticed is gas and that is only a day or two after the injection. (On belly) the injection itself does not hurt. I find that it gives me a bit more energy throughout the day. I do notice that eating sugar or things that contain any sugar like fruit make me nauseous along with over eating. But I still do get very hungry throughout the day. I find that I cannot eat as much as before starting this medication. I have changed my diet and started walking on a daily basis."

I didn't even feel the shot at all, I put it in my upper left thigh- where I dont have much feeling anyway. I did get a slight headache later in the day, but nothing else. I woke up this morning w very little uneasiness to my stomach but it quickly went away. I was expecting the worst so this has been a blessing! I did youtube another person who is taking it and she was the same way and then the upped dosage next in line kicked her butt. I hope that isnt the case for me. I am down 5lbs since I started it, 3 of which happened overnight."
Semaglutide,Wegovy,7/26/2021,Cindy,55-64,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Weight Loss Management for an Obese Person,5.0,5,5,5,2.0,0,I took my 2nd injection 3 days ago and so far so good.  My doctor prescribed an anti-nausea medication but I really haven't needed it.  The only side effect so far is constipation. The injection is extremely easy to take and not a bit painful (read the instructions or watch the video on how to give yourself the injection).  My appetite has been greatly reduced on just the smallest dose.  I don't have the cravings for sugar that I had before.  I've lost 4.3 lbs in only 10 days.  I'm hoping to lose 30 lbs overall so this is a great start.

Only side effect is mild nausea a few hours after injection, but no vomiting and it subsides fairly quickly. Makes me thirsty, I drink more water. My appetite is WAY less now and i eat way less, also. Not craving sweets or carbs. Absolute BEST weight loss medication on the market today! Preventative for weight related comorbidities such as diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, etc. The price is way too expensive, but hopefully over time it can beless than $100/mo. With the promotional discount card, it's $25/mo for 6 months max. Without insurance Wegovy and Saxenda are around $1400/mo, ridiculous prices."

I asked for the switch! And I got on it Jan 2024 and was taken off of it Dec 2024 for the reason my diabetes was cured meaning my A1C is at a normal level 5.3 and I lost 70 lbs! I can’t give all credit to Mounjaro but it definitely helped with it all, I also was Intermittent fasting and walking getting almost 8000 steps in daily! Mounjaro completely changed my life for the better though and I definitely recommend it for overweight diabetics!"

I have lost 9lbs so far being on it for  5 weeks so this is averaging 1.8lbs a week.  I am please with this and I have gained more energy for sure since starting this medication.  Some nausea but nothing to bad, I am eating healthy foods and don't crave the bad stuff much anymore, but I can tell you if your eating big meals and bad food this is when you will be sick because at first I was not eatingproperly and was sick so you have to work with the medication for it to work. Over all I have had a positive time so far and I feel like its going to keep working for me as long as I keep working at eating properly too."

That Thursday, I was fine in the morning then started feeling nauseous and lightheaded in the afternoon. After getting home terrible nausea and diarrhea started and lasted until Monday morning. I had severe pain in my entire abdominal cavity that Gas-X didn’t phase. My wife took me to the ER and all my internal organs checked out fine as did my bloodwork. Dr. Just said don’t take anymore.

I started with the 2.5 and last week i started the next dose at 5 
So far i am down 18 lbs (186 to 168) and my blood sugars has been pretty much in a normal range for the past few weeks 
This is actually a game changer
i have no cravings or barely any appetite 
Which is the reason for the weight loss 
I have not changed much about my daily life or diet the only thing I did change was drinking sodaI also noticed after the second/third day after taking injections I have a burst of energy and just like a feel good feeling 
I definitely recommend trying this 
I know some people have had bad side effects from this but at least try it it is definitely worth it 
Also side note I have tried trulicity before them switching to mounjaro and I have had horrible diarrhea and headaches so maybe if one gives side effects try a different one"

Straight away my food thoughts were vanished didn't feel hungry.  2nd Injection  and week not too bad had alot of acid reflux and took antacids.  3rd week feeling OK until Thurs started with the eggy burps  stomach off and slight diarrea. 4th week, projectile vomiting, constant diarrea  which actually had a very bad smell and was explosive, very bad stomach pains  had to be sick to relieve the pain. A war was taking  place in my tummy. This lasted a full week and I ended up in the A&E  put on a magnesium drip and anti sickness tablets. I was advised to stop the Mounjaro. The day I was due for another Injection my symptoms disappeared.  I know people who have lost 6 stones and had no side effects at all.  Im so disappointed ??"

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,4/3/2025,Susan,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,3,1,5,3,1,0,"I was prescribed blood pressure medication that when taken as instructed, caused me to gain approx. 10 pounds a month. I have tried several different types and every BP medication makes me balloon. I go off the medication and I drop the pounds. I start a new one, I gain weight. As a result of my weight yo-yo-ing and progressively going up my blood sugar #s are going up too. Diets (under 1500 calories) and daily exercise did nothing. My Dr. put me on Mounjaro 3 and a half months ago. 2.5, 5, 7.5and now I am starting 10. At 2.5 to 7.5 I was HANGRY 24/7. The ""food noise"" people talk about was off the charts. I felt like I was dehydrated all the time - no amount of water would stop that feeling. The BP medication gave me colitis symptoms - Mounjaro fixed that. I do feel better slightly taking Mounjaro than not taking Mounjaro. No abdominal pain, no back pain, no neck/thyroid issues, no allergy symptoms. Let's hope that 10 will yield different results. Others I know on this product dropped 30 to 50 pounds in 3 months. I gained 10 pounds. I will update this post if I can after a whole month on 10."

But i tried again, this time being more careful. 2nd batch I started on a Thursday, felt no different however come friday my entire attitude towards food was different.

I ate very little Fri, Sat, Sun and Mon and what I did eat I only craved healthy food options. My appetite returned fully on tues and wed however I still kept to eating healthy. 

I'm about to start my2nd injection tomorrow. I LOVE what this drug has done for me. My relationship with food has changed completely. I lost 8lbs in just 1 week and I am very hopeful for the future. I have simply no interest in any of the unhealthy food I used to binge on.

I 1000% recommend however it is said it does not work for everyone, I am very blessed that it has so far worked for me."

My weight currently is 79.3KG's my height is 170cm, so my goal is to reach around 73KG's. I feel much better than I use to, fluid in my legs has gone, fat belly gone, I have almost reduced alcohol intake to zero from twenty units per week. I am eating much healthier; myexercise consists of walking my dog and golf. I have not suffered any side effects from using Mounjaro (that I am aware of), I guess I've been lucky.

I also needed to get my weight down to an acceptable level.  Appetite suppressant worked great.  I had to learn the hard way not to overeat even though I was full.  I eat like I had weight loss surgery, make good choices and drink lots of water.  It is not a license to eat junk.  It gives you a chance to adjust your way of eating to a healthier lifestyle without feeling like you are starving.  I feel better, my vision is better and my blood sugars are dropping."

I've encountered no significant adverse effects. The only noticeable change was a marked decrease in appetite for the first 24 hours post-injection. While some might describe this as nausea, I experienced no typical gastrointestinal symptoms. In fact, I've found it challenging to maintain my planned 1200-calorie daily diet. Mounjaro effectively curbs my appetite, naturally creating a calorie deficit. Ihighly recommend it, particularly for individuals struggling with a toxic relationship with food."

But, I can say a couple great things about it are that it’s taken my appetite away and I can go 24 hours straight and only eat once and still on insulin.. But the worst side effect and something new to me is the bad constipation. It’s the only side effect that will stop my from taking my eighth shot.. I’ve lost weight and fluid but it’s not worth the side effects.."

I was seriously impressed. The first two weeks were a breeze—no side effects at all, and I was loving it. I couldn’t wait to move up to 5mg.

But in the third week, still at 2.5mg, things took a turn. The nausea hit me hard—it was unbearable. I felt constantly bloated, like food was just sitting in my stomach, undigested. Sleeping became a struggle, and on top of that, I had terrible diarrhea and theworst burps imaginable. My appetite was almost nonexistent. Some days, I barely managed to eat 1,500 calories, and honestly, there were days I was fine with eating nothing at all.

The weight loss has been incredible, and I love how I look, but I feel awful. I’m really hoping these side effects ease up because the results are amazing—I just need to feel as good as I look!"

All going well until about day 3. Then the side effects hit and I’ve never been so poorly in my life. The diarrhoea was uncontrollable, the gas explosive and the tummy pains excruciating. I couldn’t go to work as I had to be close to a toilet. Even Imodium didn’t help. I completely lost my appetite and had to make myself eat only for everything to reappear hours later.

My side effects are more like an allergic reaction that landed me in ED twice. After injecting I started sneezing constantly for about 24 hours. 6 hours after injecting my tongue started to burn and throat felt funny. 48 hours later my tongue, throat, lips were burning and tingling I thought my throat was going to close. I had heart palpitations and inside my head felt funny, I was light headed. Went to ED. 48 hours another attack which was worse than before, I thought I was going to die. These attacks lasted 4 hours then still left with burning tingling tongue. I had another two more attacks but not as bad. My tongue was so white too very weird. Today is day 12 I still have burning tongue but it's manageable. I felt like Drs were useless basically gave me nothing and told me to ride it out. I have advised the Therapeutic Advisory Board. I am allergic to bee stings and high grade manuka honey so I'm.not sure if this is why I reacted so bad.

My first week was a lot better than I anticipated. Having to go the restroom almost immediately after eating a meal is not too far off from what I experience with IBS so just making sure a restroom is available is a must.
I did have a few headaches and a bit tired more than normal and a lot of burping. I started my 2nd dose of 2.5 last night (Sun) and after I ate my breakfast, boy did I feel bad! Horrible bloating, diarreah, nausea and stomach pain for a fewhours. It has subsided but I'm just puzzled as to why it bothered me so much this time. I hope this is just a fluke."

Unfortenatley there is huge difference in the design/funcionalety of the injection pen.

All bad reviews are being not allowed on sites such as drugs.com as they are paid big money by certain companies. If you inject this drug you will lose your appetite yes. Along with that though you won’t enjoy anything anymore, a coffee, a tea you will vomit . For me, the second day I became dangerously sick, taken by ambulance. Treated for dehydration. 10 days later I’m still not Ok. I feel extremely weak & I’ve stop vomiting finally but still feel sick every waking minute."

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,11/24/2024,Lily,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I’ve been taking Mounjaro for six weeks (choosing to stay on 2.5mg for month two) and so far I’ve lost 14lbs of the 21lbs I need to lose. I’ve had no side effects at all, apart from a little nausea one time when I had a largish meal to be polite, and in fact I feel better than I have done in years. I have symptomatic hypertension and all that discomfort has gone. 
I do worry about the potential serious risks of taking such a new drug, but right now I’m weighing that against the known serious risks of being overweight and eating too many sugary foods. I’ve gone from having a sweet tooth to almost no interest in biscuits and chocolate or any kind of snacking between meals. I feel liberated from something I didn’t even appreciate was so much on my mind each day, but I think I have been lucky in my response to the drug as I know this low dose doesn’t suppress appetite for some people so effectively or causes unpleasant side-effects. 
I hope when I reach my target weight I’ll have had a reset on my habits but that may be optimistic, so that’s possibly when the hard yards begin."

I wish I had some suggestions on what to do with it. I also get the sulfur burps just prior to the diarrhea. I’ve started taking a little bit of Pepto-Bismol and that seems to have helped a bit. Third dose coming up. One thing that I found though on the second dose, I had the first day diarrhea. It went away for almost 4 days and then came back. I don’t know if this is common or not. Gonna try and stick it out but it’sbeen a little bit miserable, the first two weeks."

I have experienced nauseousness primarily the first two days after each injection with burping at a greater level daily. I have, through my doctor's advice, been following a diabetic diet and walking daily with upper body weight - lifting three times weekly. The appetite suppression is significant from day two after injection through day four or five with suppression easing the balance of the week, however, a small amount of food makes me full when the suppression eases. I started at a weight of 286 pounds and am now down to 243 pounds for a total of 43 pound weight loss in a little more than 9 1/2 weeks. The weight loss has been a little quicker than I would have anticipated, however, the diet and exercise recommended by Lilly and my doctor has made the weight loss more effective, in my opinion. I eat only what my body allows and am careful not to over eat and avoid high fat / high carb foods altogether. The only other side effect experienced is slow bowl movements which likely is a result of the lower amount of food intake. My doctor plans to hold me at 7.5 mg for the foreseeable future as he monitors the weight loss and effects on my A1C levels (I was only diagnosed as a diabetic prior to beginning mounjaro). My suggestion to anyone considering this treatment is to listen to what your body is telling you concerning tolerance of the medication and what / what not to eat along with amounts. Don't focus solely on the weight loss as everyone must remember it was originally developed for diabetes management with weight loss as a beneficial side effect."

I look miles better as at 5”10 I was 17st. Easy to use but there are a few side effect I have had. The main things are tiredness and aching legs and butt. It really does stop you gorging on foods and you eat small portions but most foods you lose the love for and are not really bothered about eating but you know you have to for energy. For me it has been a hard slog but the results far outweighs the side effects. You will eat better and when you see the results you will start to change your food habits. I have eaten more fruit in 5 months than I have in 5 years and really enjoy a plate of mixed fruits rather than chocolate and crisps.

I am too early into it to see the any weight loss benefits but am hopeful. I am only about 40lbs overweight but would like it to go. Very encouraged by my progress so far!
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,10/7/2024,DXBMum,45-54,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,4,4,5,3,1,0,"I began using Mounjaro to help shed the 3 extra kilograms I gained over the holidays. I'm not overweight or diabetic (I’m 165 cm tall and started at 59 kg), but I struggled to lose the weight this time. With menopause affecting my hormones, it became harder to drop those extra kilos, even though I lead an active lifestyle, working out 3-4 times a week and staying generally active.

After doing some research, I felt Mounjaro would be the right fit for me. I started with a 0.25 mg injection when Iweighed 58.7 kg.

As for the injection, it was simple to administer and completely painless. 

After the first dose, it took about two days to feel any effects. I experienced some mild diarrhea but otherwise felt fine—no nausea or major side effects. I began losing weight on day 3, and by the end of the first week, my appetite had decreased significantly. I was eating about half of what I normally would, and my weight dropped to 57.6 kg.

During the second week, I noticed my muscle mass decreasing (I track it with my EufyLife Scale), and I constantly felt thirsty. I also had a strange taste in my mouth, like I was detoxing. The diarrhea persisted, but there was no constipation. Unfortunately, my sleep quality began to suffer, as I would wake up around 3 a.m. and struggle to fall back asleep. By the end of week 2, I weighed 55.7 kg.

After my third injection, I began experiencing low blood pressure, constant fatigue, and weakness. My appetite vanished completely, and I had to force myself to eat, which was a bit alarming. My sleep continued to be disrupted, waking at 3 a.m. and struggling with insomnia, which likely contributed to my low energy levels. I also began experiencing brain fog, finding it hard to focus during conversations and struggling to concentrate at work. This has affected my productivity and overall quality of life, leaving me considering whether to discontinue the treatment.

By the end of week 3, I reached 54.5 kg, which was my goal. However, the impact on my overall well-being makes me think that the side effects are not worth continuing."

After nearly 6 months on the higher dose of Mounjaro my arthritis inflammation became more pronounced and I felt highly levels of joint pain. Also I felt less energy and interest in doing many daily tasks. Trying to identify the cause of these issues I decided to stop taking Mounjaro and within two weeks my arthritis pain was much lower andI didn’t need to take any NSAIDs for relief. Also, I also discovered that I no longer have ED, something I’ve had since first starting Mounjaro nearly two years ago. It seems to me that there are more side effects from Mounjaro than have been reported. I’ve decided to eliminate Mounjaro completely from my diabetes regimen."
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,8/25/2024,RA17,45-54,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,5,1,0,"Before starting, I read a review stating that 18lbs was lost in the first month whilst taking the lowest 2.5mg dose.  This one review inspired me to give it a go.  I was extremely sceptical, but having tried other weight loss methods i decided to go ahead.  Amazingly, in 1 month i also lost 18lbs.  Hunger disappears almost immediately, and should you eat anyway there is a feeling of discomfort.  I can't say that there are no side effects, stool became infrequent and sleep may have not been as before, although whether that is caused by it i can't confirm.  However these are not serious side effects and in my opinion these are well worth enduring.  I'm now on a higher dose and am extremely happy with both the results and the effects.  
The downside is the relatively high price.  I am also aggrieved by the amount of wastage within the injection module, there is at least one weeks dose wasted from each months supply."

Reduced HbA1c through diet and weight loss but felt overly constrained by restricted diet.

HbA1c back to within normal range and all high BG symptoms e.g. feet tingling have gone.  Lost 11Kg (110 - 99) in 12 weeks but seem to have plateaued now.  Only bad symptoms occurred when on holiday I ate full english breakfasts - something I otherwise never do.  So I worked out that full portions of fatty foods are a no go. I've stayed on 5mg.

I’ve been using a glucose monitor to keep on and eye on what’s happening. 
I’ve just taken my 4th dose of 2.5ml today and so far I have been very lucky with side effects, pretty much just headaches on and off and I would say my near vision has been more blurry - but I also wear glasses and have started to get a reading prescription, so could be a coincidence.

I’m trying to drink 2-3 pints of water a day alongside usual tea and coffee consumption and haven’t yet had any problems with loose or hard stools.

My glucose is amazing! I’m so shocked and delighted in equal measures and I’ve lost 5lb as of this morning (20 days) - which is actually great for me, I’m happy with 1.5-2lb a week loss, feels realistic. 

Will update again in a few weeks. 
I’ve decided to stick with 2.5ml for my next 4 doses as my body seems to be doing well."

I’m now having to remind myself to eat but struggling to eat more that 700 calories a day. I’ve had no side affects and I lost 8lb in the first week and seems to be averaging a loss of 1/2lb a day!

I began taking this medication in the first week of April 2024 at the 2.5mg dose. After 4 weeks I had lost 14.5lbs (a stone!). This week I increased to the 5mg dose and have lost a further 3.3lbs. I am averaging a healthy weight loss of 1.5kg per week. I have had absolutely no adverse side effects whatsoever so far.  My appetite is significantly reduced and like other reviewers I havelost all cravings for sugar or sweets. I get full and stay full for much longer from smaller portions. As my appetite is reduced I am finding it a struggle to consume more than 1100 calories a day so I have ensured that I am eating healthy balanced meals to ensure I get decent nutrition / vitamins etc but other than this I have made no other lifestyle changes. I would recommend this medication to anyone who has struggled with binge eating, snacking, or cravings. The changes in my eating habits happened overnight and I have maintained the same energy levels despite drastically reducing my calorie intake thanks to Mounjaro.  I believe the 5mg dose is enough for me so intend to stay on this plan and not increase unless I begin to see my weight loss plateau before my goal weight is reached."

In four months on Mounjaro I have lost a grand total of 5 pounds. This is really perplexing given that I am eating a great deal less than I used to eat.

I was quite literally in the best shape of my life at 46 years old. Then like a flash, Covid hits and we go into lock down. If I am not active, I get really bad about eating. I mean really bad. Entire ice cream cakes multiple times a week, chips, cookies, candy.....you get the gist. Mostly it's from boredom but it quickly turns into an addictive habit to mask my own personal struggles. (never fully recovered 9/11 survivor and recovering Alcoholic.) I don't drink (haven't in nearly 20 years), don't smoke and somehow, in 1 year, my weight climbed to 195 lbs. How did I eat myself to that weight? Especially since I am only 5'6"". What a nightmare I got myself into....again. I somehow let this crazy eating cycle continue until I reached an absolute breaking point. Bottom if you may. I made a decision to commit to a new me, a healthy me and one that will be around for my daughter for a long time. I started Mounjaro 3 weeks ago when I weighed in at 194 lbs in my doctor's office, switched to a fully plant based diet, cut out ALL sugar, eliminated processed foods and I am exercising religiously. My weight as of the typing of this review is 176 lbs. My goal is to get back to the 145-150 range and hopefully ween off of the medication if I can. Fingers crossed. For anyone who is reading this that is struggling, I hope you hear my message as one of support because I know how easy it is to mask life's issues with food.  I have spent my entire life losing weight, gaining it back and adding a little extra. I just got sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. I know my weight loss is not a ton, but at the end of the day, we are all looking to accomplish the same thing. Know that you are worth the effort to me, friends, family, neighbors, kids, etc. You can lose the weight and be a new you.  Just stay committed to making a mindset shift and don't view this as a ""diet"". View this as a positive lifestyle change that will keep you planted on the earth for a long time and not planted in it before it's your time. I could not be happier and I know you will as well. Just be patient and let the universe drive during this journey."

In 2 months A1C moved from 6.5 to 4.1. Started on 2.5mg for 3 months, 5 mg for 3 months and now 7.5. My current weight 160 and my goal is 144. Mounjaro is controlling A1C, reducing sugar cravings, and make portion control easy for me. I no longer use metformin or Jardience. Once I stay at goal weight for 3+ months, I plan to have a breast reduction and lift (no implants) to complement my healthier body. My body has experienced less inflammation as arthritis, headaches and fibromyalgia are improved by better food choices and higher activity resulting in weight loss. Mounjaro is an excellent tool for people with weight challenge, reducing A1C and reducing cardiovascular risks. I am so thankful for this!"

I started taking the 2.5mg dosage exactly 1 month ago for type 2 diabetes and obesity. When I started, I weighed 291lbs, and today's I weigh 270---that's an incredible 21lb weight loss in just one month!!!! Now, I did start eating healthy and exercising at the same time; but I truly believe I could not have done this w/o the Mounjaro. In the past, my biggest problem was that I was a binge-eater: eating whatever I was craving for in very large quantities. But the immediate effects I noticed with this AMAZING MED is that it took all my cravings away; and I actually don't really think about food at all. I hardly ever need to eat more than 1,500 calories per day. The only side-effect that I did notice was that I was generally tired in the 1st week after taking it; but my body has adjusted and I'm good now. For the first time in over 17 yrs, I truly believe that Mounjaro will help me get to my goal weight of 178.

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,2/2/2024,HOU,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5,5,5,5,,1,"Started on 2.5 in August because I was looking for one medication to lower A1C. Currently on Metformin and Jardiance. By November, A1C dropped from 6.9 to 5.8. Changing diet also helped lower cholesterol. I titrated up to 5 mg, but since then I've gone back to 2.5 due to not wanting to lose any more weight. I lost a total of 30 pounds and have been maintaining my weight for the past 30 days, which I'm comfortable with. I worked out 3-5 days a week during this time and did intermittent fasting. Even with working out, I noticed muscle and strength loss, so I'm now doing more strength training to build back up. Currently, 2.5 mg does not suppress my appetite, but it continues to help me with glucose levels. I wear a CGM. I hope to keep the weight off with the tools I've learned in the past six months. I experienced minimal side effects on both doses, occasionally slight headache and constipation. My goal is to eliminate all other medications and stay on this low dose as my only medication for diabetes."

I like the medicine since it’s helping me with my blood sugar but I hate it when I feel nauseous and have heartburn in the night, that makes me can’t sleep well.

I have PCOS and up until 9 years ago the only treatment I was given was low dose birth control... until I met my Dr for life. 
I've been eating Low Carb for 3 years and Nutritional Keto for 8 months now. (Virta) 
When I started I was 347lbs. I am 5'2.. I was spherical .  I dropped weight rapidly (around  170lbs) and then laziness got me back up 40lbs.  
My Dr started me on Mounjaro after tellingher about the "" food noise"" and the difficulty maintaining 20 or less carbs and my borderline Type 2 A1C for the last decade.
Mounjaro has helped immensely.  I've had digestion issues and injection site rashes due to my already super sensitive skin. Hydrocortisone cream and resisting the urge to scratch has helped.

I stalled out on 7.5mg & experienced the dreaded food noise, weight loss stall and hunger. After discussing what was going on with my Dr, she bumped me up to 10mg & I'm doing much better.  I just did my 3rd week injection this morning and that 40lb gain is gone.  
The weight loss has been slow and steady but more importantly I am eating healthier, feeling satisfied and I can now determine food noise from actual hunger. 
For those of you struggling I can't stress this enough ..talk to your Dr. ! They should be able to help & guide you where you need to be and if they don't...find someone who will. 

Good luck & great health!

I started 2.5 mg June 23, 2023 and have lost 65 lbs as of Nov. 6th.  I have had no side effects whatsoever thankfully and the appetite suppression has been a game changer for me.  I used to think about food constantly.  Iwould go to bed thinking about what to have for breakfast.  Now, my mind is calm regarding food.  I eat much smaller portions, get full faster and stay full longer.  I don't crave sweets like I used to and overall just try to eat better than I did before.  I'm not saying I'm eating lettuce and ice for meals, I still eat pretty much whatever sounds good but I find that I lean towards very small portions and more veggies and fruits.  I also take bariatric vitamins with mine just to make sure I'm getting the nutrients I need to keep any unwanted side effects at bay.  I will keep on my journey and hope this helps someone along the way.  I am at 10 mg now btw and intend to stay at this level as long as I continue to lose weight.

Every type of diet tried in the past with great results for each, but at 316 lbs this year, no longer had the discipline or physical ability to repeat any of those efforts.  Started on Mounjaro  paying my own way, on March 3rd of this year. 
43 weeks in, with no side effects of any type; I've lost 103 lbs.  Eating far less and healthy as I'm able, but no food regimen of any type. Same for exercise.  This is a miracle drug, with terrific results for blood pressure (now 118/68), A1c (5.7), PSA actually decreasing (.15) and walking up to 3 miles at a time vs 1 block in March.
Cost is the only prohibitive factor for folks.  Cancer, heart disease and diabetes don't cause obesity. The profession seems to have it backwards regarding treatment.  Hoping medicare realizes this sooner than later. Thanks again for your  help."

I have lost 100 pounds as of 10-9-23. I walk 3 miles a day at a fast pace finishing  in 45 mins. I eat a very low carb diet. If I eat too much I get that sick feeling and know not to eat anymore. I eat about 4-6 ounces of protein at lunch and dinner with 2 vegetables at each meal. Breakfast I drink a premier protein shake because it has the least amount of sugar. For a snack I eat nuts, or a TBL of peanut butter. No soda, yogurt, pasta, breads, limit fruit. As of 6-3-23 I was taken off of BP, cholesterol, asthma medication. My A1C went from 7.6 to 4.2. I use a dessert plate for my meals so it helps with portions control. I take my shot 7.5 on Thursday evening so that if it does cause me to be ill 2 days after it would be on the weekend when I am off work. I read that from another review that they did that. If you eat to much, wrong foods (sugar, carbs, raw veggies, pork, beef) you will get sick. Side effects for me on month 3 was heart burn (Rolaids, Tums helped) after that month I haven't had an issue."

I've lost a total of 30lbs. Still feel good. More energy. Mood better. 
Only side effect I've had going up in dose is the first time I did the injection of 5 I felt super nauseous and ended up throwing up a lot. By third day I was fine again. Did second injection and same thing happened. However I noticed I didn't feel the best right after having dairy and popcorn. So the third week of 5 I avoided anything dairy or greasy. And no corn popcorn and did fine. After fourth injection felt fine too. Seems if I avoid anything hard on digestive system for a few days I'm fine. 
I’ve noticed I cannot tolerate red meat or ham very well. Also have to limit my dairy. No yellow cheese. White cheese can tolerate in small amounts. 
Despite on 2.5 dosage I could eat anything no problem. Just didn’t eat very much. 
So be mindful that if you ate fine on first dosage doesn’t mean you will be able to as you up the dosage. I keep a log of what I eat and how I feel afterwards so I can see what may be bothering me."

Absolutely no side effects. I am so thankful! I cannot eat like I did before as I get full very quickly. I no longer crave sweets or carb rich foods.

I follow a pretty healthy 1200-1500 calorie diet combined with intermittent fasting. My A1C is now 5.1 and I have lost 70 pounds.  I’m currently on the 13.5 dose.  I began this journey in order to have total hip replacement surgery. At the 30 pound loss I no longer needed any prescription pain meds.  The only problem I have encountered is constipation. I use flax seed in my oatmeal or yogurt daily for excellent results.(1/3 of the suggested daily amount works for me)
This medication has totally changed my life.  Now, if they would just MAKE enough of it and get the price down to just ridiculous maybe many more can benefit."

I had an A1C of nearly 10 and she said you are this close to a heart attack or a stroke. I very defiantly yelled at her and said then help me! She is not one to prescribe stuff willy nilly so she reluctantly put me on Mounjaro and I'm so glad she did. It is the end of September, I've lost 22 lbs and my A1C is 6.5! I have energy like nobody's business and I eat right and exercise daily! I am on the lowest dosage and I have not had side effects but sometimes I am not hungry. She also took me off 3 diabetic meds!

No side effects. Was on 2.5 for 7 weeks then saw PCP. My weight went from a starting weight 272 lbs to 251 lbs. I'm 5'9"". My A1C went from a 10.2% to 6.3% after 7 weeks on 2.5. At PCP appt. I was increased to mounjaro 5 at that visit. Still no side effects. On 08/22/23 Lab collected 5 weeks later on mounjaro 5 in Sept, A1C now 5.6%. It is so wonderful to feel what ""normal"" must feel like. Minimal appetite,no side effects so far after 5 weeks. Weight loss. Hope it helps my cholesterol. Have to make myself eat. Making so much better food choices, healthy food when I do eat. No sugar cravings at all. My blood sugars were over 250 to start now 95-101 in the mornings. I want to go up to the 7.5 next primary care visit in November and stay on that dose through the upcoming holidays. Mounjaro is life altering and life changing! I've never felt so wonderful! I would like to get down to approximately 160 which is still a little bit to go. I weigh in and take my injection every Saturday. On 09/22/23 I weighed in at 237.8. That's 34.2 less pounds since 06/06 and starting Mounjaro! So still have 77.8 pounds to go. My next immediate goal is to be below 200 lbs by New Year's Eve.(Fingers crossed).

Mounjaro has allowed me to cut my portions and not have any cravings for burgers or large meals. Still eating 3 times a day or more, and more importantly, I am getting proper nutrition. Want to patent my Mounjaro diet and sell it. ?? No secrets are free in life. I should also add, I cannot do cardio at all. I had a 12 hour back surgery 6 years ago and am federally (and more significantly for me, physically) disabled. I go through alot of pain and am unable to move around much at all sometimes.

Nothing worked and I really didn't eat that much but the belly weight stayed. No matter how much I dieted or exercised. Since the good Lord helped, my Dr put me on mounjaro.  I have lost weight, walking at lrk and most importantly all my lab numbers have gone normal and have dropped from 40 to 100 pts. Even my liver numbers.  I still am having to be checked but so far they are n normal range still.  I have had one episode of abdominal pain but can't swear that was the mounjaro or diverticulitis when I first started. Now I eat basically one good meal a day  fruit or something light for  the other 2. I haven't been hungry or deprived of anything you just don't want it and you are able to do other activities that you haven't been able or felt like doing before , so u don't think about eating.i walk at least 2 hrs a day 3 days a week not strenuous just leisurely around stores treadmill or neighborhood. Or I swim.  I can do my house and yardwork now and I finally feel like I have had a break through. I don't like taking medication and I drag my feet with my Dr when she suggests a new one, but I am so thankful I listened to her about this drug it has made such a difference in my life and health.  I wish all PCOS women, overweight people and diabetics could get on this drug and help them like it's helped me. Even with the abdominal pain the proof is in my lab numbers that it's worked for me.

Just took my 4th injection of the 2.5 and have lost 15.9lbs so far and my A1C went from 7.6 when last tested and my average for the last 3 weeks has been 6.3 (I wear a CGM). I feel so much better. Only issue I have had is first day I ate to fast as was in a hurry and ate to much and tummy felt like pressure of feeling over full. Only other time was I tried a fruit drink and the sugars going way up made me a bit nauseous. Those are the only things I’ve noticed. So I just make sure to eat slower and pay attention to feeling satisfied rather than full like diabetes counselor recommended. 
Next week I go up to 5 dosage.

My tidbit that has helped me so much is wearing a CGM because it’s helped give me a way better insight into what affects my sugars and how they are doing on a daily. Plus showing me mounjaro is helping."

Liver CT confirmed severe nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. I brought the idea of mounjaro to my doc because recent trials indicate great result for my health conditions. From the first dose, I had so much more energy - feel 20 years younger. I have more energy to exercise and my muscles recover from use much more quickly. I don't think my body has been processing energy correctly foryears. The ""food"" voice in my head is also quiet for the first time in 30 years. Downside is I don't feel like shopping or cooking for the family! Eating small meals, avoiding carbs and fats means no stomach upset. I used prilosec for the first month but once I adjusted, I stopped using it. I still take daily probiotics to encourage good gut health. Fruit, prunes, figs help everything keep moving even at 7.5mg dose.  My numbers are all down and liver function has improved in only 3 months. I look forward to seeing the numbers at 1 year. However, the primary benefit is that I feel great and can participate in my life so much more. This is a great drug and it is criminal that health insurance, including Medicare, does not cover it. I don't mind cost sharing  - eyeing a piece a cake and thinking whether it is worth $1000 is hefty motive to avoid it - but this drug has real health and quality of life benefits that insurance should help cover. Everyone in my family dies of cardiovascular disease of some kind - stroke, heart attack, heart failure. I am relieved to have a drug that can help fight against this future. The unexpected benefit is how great I feel while I am improving my health.  We all need to work hard with our state and federal regulators to make sure this drug and related ones are covered under both public and private health insurance plans."

Constipation is not great but manageable.  I find that 7.5mg does not work as well as the 5mg.  Any nausea can be managed by eating.  Only feels sick if I don't eat anything.  This medication can make you not to want to eat at all but you have to.  It has been the best thing ever except for the cost.  My insurance will not cover it even if approved for weight loss.

Moved up to the 5.0 mg dose after 4 weeks and have occasional mild nausea when I eat too much or eat stuff I really shouldn't, and still have the mild fatigue for two days after injection. Started at 309 lbs, down to 287 as of today. I am hoping the 7.5 mg dose becomes available again soon. I am very happy with Mounjaro."

Been on 5.0 for about 3 months now and I am on to 7.5. I have lost about 15 lbs now total and my A1c is alot better. I have to say though that I am on this medication because of diabetes and the constant shortages have had an impact on me. For the folks that are looking for weight loss from an injection @ $1,000 a month maybe just clear out your pantry of chips and pop and get a membership to the gym. That way people like myself that need it can have access. I cleared out the chips and pop and sugar 15 years ago."

I stayed on that dose. I started at 193lbs. I’m not diabetic. Now I’m 133lbs. I would lose about 3-4 lbs a week.  After 6-7 months of weekly injections, I started spreading out the shots. To 10 days, 14, now I’m at 17 days. I filled my script up to the end of June.  I have enough to take up til mid Jan

No real major side effects. It actually helped my digestion. I used to have constipation before thanking the injections. NowI go regularly every day. 
I do get a pressure in my upper abdomen after taking the shot, heart flutters, and sometimes a tightness in my throat. It fades as the days go on. My blood work for my health assessment is in good shape. Bp is down."

It has been something very difficult to manage to say the least. My A1c have yo-yo'd from most recent was 11.4 and the lowest was an 8.9, a constant struggle. I am 5'1"" and last weigh in was 219 at my PCP, so I was prescribed Mounjaro 2.5mg and next day I was so nauseated I had to go buy Emetrol. I had to learn to adjust everything that I ate, portions, I come from a generation that you had to eat everything off your breakfast, lunch and dinner plates. I now do not do that at all, I eat until I sense being full, my portions are like for a toddler and I am ok with that. I do not crave bread, sweets, or fried. It has been 2 months now and I am down to 206, I feel excited to continue the health eating. I am not a picky eater at all but find myself wanting healthier foods, natural plant based foods and fat free protein. I don't question it but my mind guides me to healthy choices just for the organic flavor of the food. If I eat anything that I am not supposed to eat is when I get symptoms of nausea, and I use to be regular with BM but now find myself doing more stool softeners or prune juice once a week to stay regular. I have incorporated 30 minutes on a treadmill  or a brisk bike ride at least 3 times a week and 5lb weights workout in between. Do I recommend this?, well yes I do if it will help you get into a much healthier routine because it is very hard to get into one. I should add that I am a cardio patient with 3 stents, DM2 insulin dependent and breast and ovarian survivor and I am only 52. I still have more living to do in this lifetime."

The end of June was my last dose because the coupon card finally expired. In 8 months I lost 102 pounds. No excercise. I ate what I wanted but in moderation and Mounjaro helped with that.

I felt slightly nauseous the first week but haven’t felt sick since. You definitely do not want to eat too much or eat spicy food, especially at first. Though I am losing slowly, I’m losing at a faster pace than my 11 years ago younger self lost on low carb. I have an appetite for food but just don’t want much of it.

Note I'm very sensitive to all meds. A little goes a long way. Must track calories and keep at 1200 if you have trouble losing weight anyway.  2 months on 2.5 only side effects relatively bad constipation until day before next shot. Taking a laxative every other day helps. You must drink a lot of water. Lost 4 lbs first week but for me weight loss has been slow with hungar returning 2 days before next shot and calories increase to 1500. But prior was not able to stay at 1200 calories no matter what I did due to hunger. 3rd month went up to 5.5 dose. Same side effect. 4th month same. Weight loss of about 2 lbs a week. Eating a 3rd to half less at meals. Food thoughts a lot less too. All bearable. 5th month went up to 10.5 dose. First shot just normal side effect. 2nd shot of 20.5 all hell broke loose. Took my dose Sunday evening.  Monday afternoon gastro side effects started. Tuesday terrible intestinal cramps, near constant diarrhea, horrible gas burps. Thank God I've got a bidet. Could not leave house. No amount of anti diarrhea meds or Zofran helped. Wednesday about the same. But well enough loaded up on anti diarrhea med to go to a standalone IV drip place because its cheaper than urgent care. I knew as was dehydrated.  Felt better but still not normal stomach wise. Today, Thursday still sick with cramps , nausea cannot leave the house. Going down to 7.5 and skip a few days before injecting again. Dr. appointment on Monday for yearly physical."

The things I have been so impressed with is that I do not stress eat, I am choosing healthy meals and I am not hungry. I have noticed that eating healthy food helps me avoid the sometimes nausea I experience. I do have to pay 995 dollars a monthwhich is more than my social security check. But I am choosing to be healthy. I am grateful for this game changing medication. I lost a child to suicide 14 years ago and gained weight that I have not been able to loose.

My appetite has definitely decreased, but I make myself eat with my priority of meeting a protein goal of 1 gram per pound of body weight to preserve muscle mass.  I had lost 15 pounds prior to starting Mounjaro and that took roughly a year to do that, so I'll continue to lose slowly.  My blood sugar is averaging 80s to 90s now.

I experienced no negative side effects and was increased to the 5mg dosage beginning the fifth week. Again, no negative side effects from the increased dose. I had already began eating better and walking at the time of diagnosis, so it’s hard for me to say how much of an effect Mounjaro has had on my appetite and weight loss, but today, July 4, 2023, my A1C is 5.1 and I am down 80lbs. My doctor was very impressed and credited my success primarily to my lifestyle changes, however, the medication is definitely doing its job. My dosage has now been reduced back to 2.5mg.

The first month very little side effects and decent appetite suppression. Week 5 and 6 I’m getting bouts of 1 to 2 hours of nausea and heartburn. Just suffered through one. They happen maybe once a day early afternoons or evening. Todays was the worst and now I feel fantastic. The symptoms come in like an incoming tide and abruptly leave. 

I’m encouraged by some of the similar reviews where the side effects eventually subsided after 2 or 3 months. Hopefully mine will too. I notice I have to force myself to eat 200-400 calories 4 or 5 times a day. I don’t want to lose too much muscle. Kicking in bicycling this week. 

Almost a miracle drug for my health. I’ve lost 10 pounds, my BP is normal and my sugar levels in range. Along with food it’s really important to drink water constantly. I drink a gallon a day. 

Mounjaro is doing what I couldn’t do alone. It’s a great tool if can tolerate. I want to thank everyone who has shared. I hope my post helps others."

I am a senior citizen and use medicare (as I have earned that right) and do not qualify for any kind of savings coupon or program from Eli Lilly.  What did the senior citizens of this country ever do to Eli Lilly that we don't qualify to save any money when buying this drug?
My doctor told me I might soon become pre-diabetic if I do not lose weight. I have tried numerous ways to lose weight and so far Mounjaro is the only thing that has helped.  Many seniors are in the same situation and could use something as effective a Mounjaro, but apparently Eli Lilly has it in for us.
Not surprising is that Eli Lilly was ordered to pay $61 million for skimping out on Medicaid rebates and vowed to fight the verdict. But instead of the result Lilly wanted, the award has been tripled to more than $183 million.

An Illinois federal judge (Harry Leinenweber) ruled that Eli Lilly owes triple damages from last year's award after whistleblower Ronald Streck convinced a jury that the company violated the False Claims Act and short-changed Medicaid on rebate payments.

Since the case falls under the False Claims Act, the award was eligible for ""trebled"" damages, according to court filings.

The case dates to 2014, when whistleblower Streck—a pharmacist and lawyer—sued Eli Lilly for allegedly launching retroactive price increases and failing to pay Medicaid rebates based on the higher prices.

Way to go Eli Lilly ... keep up the good work of making Americans pay through the nose for medications that can help improve quality of life."

I have lost 5 lbs with Mounjaro over 5 weeks and I am within 3 lbs of my goal of 140,  Mounjaro is sometimes a trial for a few hours after the shot.  After dieting my whole life I know that the last few pounds are the hardest to lose, but with Mounjaro I feel that I can lose down to my goal and maybe a little more.

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,5/31/2023,Annette,65-74,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I was previously on Trulicity, however it stopped working for me and my A1C and fasting B/S were HIGH.  My doctor suggested Mounjaro.  I am starting week 3 and wanted to share my experience.  First of all, it changed my life so drastically that I could hardly believe it.  As others have stated, it changed my RELATIONSHIP with food.  Here are some of the changes:  I no longer focus on food or have cravings for salty and sweet, carb foods, it just seemed to vanish beginning day #3.  I no longer have the urge for late night snacking.  I really can’t eat carbs like potatoes, breads, etc. or I get a stomach ache, bad enough where I really don’t want to bring that on again by eating that food.  Big one – I was so fatigued before, I could barely make it through my workday and many times would go straight to bed.  I’m now up until bedtime and have energy, to the point that I started going into the pool and doing some gentle exercising.  Another biggie – I eat a big breakfast, usually eggs/cheese and bacon/sausage and that pretty much lasts me most of the day.  I almost have to look at the clock to see if I need to eat dinner because I just don’t get that hungry.  Oh, another biggie – I was drinking root beer, I was able to drop that completely and transition to water.  I put orange or lemon essential oil in it and am happy with sipping on that all day.  I’ve cleaned the house out of the carb stuff and given it to a family with foster children.  I don’t know what is in this medicine, but it really has made a profound impact on my life.  I’ve lost 6 pounds so far, but it feels like I’ve lost a couple inches in my clothes.  Highly Recommend!"

I have now been on Mounjaro for 4 months (2 months in 10mg and 2 months in 12.5mg).  I am tolerating Mounjaro okay; however, it has had an negative effect on my blood glucose and weight.  Since I started taking Mounjaro, I have gained 10 pounds and I have had to increase my daily insulin intake to 3x what I was taking while on Ozempic.  My diet has not changed from when I was on Ozempic.  Mounjaro does not work for me.  I am going to see if my endocrinologist can switch me back to Ozempic."

Along with the Mounjaro, I've really cut my carb intake this week in hopes of quickly getting my glucose numbers down and went from a starting weight of 168 to 160.  I have had some side effects, but nothing I can't handle. I have periods where I have no interest in food, and other times where I'm very hungry. I inject in my thigh and it stings terribly. Due to my age,I'd rather not lose the weight so fast, so I may have to increase the carbs this week. My hope is that with additional weight loss, I can reverse the diabetes and go off medication."

I had severe Nausea and Lethargy from Mounjaro and the Heartburn was awful.  Vomiting was almost daily.  Sleep went out the window.  I had zero appetite which caused the weight loss (7 and half lbs. in 2 weeks).  My energy is returning, the nausea is abating, and I can eat again.  Constipation was a problem.

I took my very first Mounjaro 2.5mg shot this morning right after breakfast.at 9:30am. Within an hour I felt weak and lethargic. My legs felt very heavy and I was walking and moving very slowly. No stomach discomfort at all.Normally I eat several times between breakfast and lunch, and then again a few times between lunch and dinner. Today, after the shot I did not feel hungry at all. I had lunch at 12:00 noon because I started to feel just a little hungry. It was a turkey burger with a slice of American cheese on two small Mission Zero carb street wraps. I was satiated after that until 4:00 pm when I had half of tonight's dinner which was the exact same turkey burger sandwich I had for lunch. My other half dinner will be Green Giant Simply Steamed riced cauliflower in a light cheese sauce which I will have maybe around 7:00 pm (ONLY IF I'M HUNGRY).. Once again I'm completely satiated, and the lethargy has subsided a little bit too.  So although it's only my first day, and first shot, I'm very pleased with the results so far. I can feel the appetite suppression starting already, which I'm sure will continue and probably even strengthen as I go. Another point of interest is that i took the shot in the muscular part of my upper thigh and I literally could not feel the needle at all. It was completely painless. I was over all pleasantly surprised with Mounjaro today. To be continued............"

I didn't go looking for the drug or even help with weight lose, I had basically given up along time ago.  I have been over weight most of my adult life and really didn't think it would be possible.  My doctor suggested Mounjaro and my wife encouraged me to try it.  They will tell you that it helps you feel full longer.  My experience teaches me that explanation is a severely oversimplified. It has completely and immediately helped me change my relationship with food.  Side effects are minimal.  At first I had cramps and nausea on the night of the injection. I learned to hydrate well for 24 hrs before hand and that is now gone.  The only lingering effect is constipation but its minor and manageable.  Honestly the hardest part is the guilt.

I wanted to mention my experience with itching and redness at the injection sites. It started when I changed to Mounjaro (from a compounding pharmacy, not the prefilled syringes). I inject the dose slowly. Then I rub the site all around the skin with an alcohol pad vigorously, to disperse the medicine around under the skin. I do this for at least 30 seconds. This has 100% cleared up the redness and terrible itching I was having after injections. Just a tipto help others who may have the same issue.

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,4/27/2023,NurseAmy,55-64,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I was on Wegovy (semaglutide) from a compounding pharmacy for 6 months since June 2022, lost 21 pounds, but the depression was not fun. I completely stopped drinking any alcohol, I didn't like the taste and had no desire for it. Your appetite will decrease and you get full really fast, don't keep eating after that or you will be nauseous. That will be your own fault, not the medicine. Pay close attention to the quality of nutrition you ingest because your intake is much lower.  

Constipation isreal, but eat more salads (fiber) and it will be fine. Exercise 3-5 times a week, even if it is just a nice walk. 

I switched to Mounjaro in January (again from a compounding pharmacy, not pre-filled syringes) the depression was better until 7.5mg, in fact I could almost say I had a ""manic"" episode for 3 months with the med combined with B6, then the compounding pharmacy was changed and they mix it with BPC 157 (a peptide that supposedly has unproven positive effects). Within 1 day of the new combination, the mania (shopping compulsion) completely stopped. Now I feel apathetic for the past 2 weeks.
I have lost 11 more pounds in 14 weeks since switching over to the Mounjaro in January. 160 is my weight now, I started at 191.

Hair loss is real (both meds), but I started with a thick head of hair so no one else notices but me. 
Eat enough protein and take hair supplement vitamins. Try to drink enough water, it will help with constipation and dizziness. 

I'm going to switch back to the Mounjaro mixed with the B6, at 5mg to try and feel happier, but hopefully not have the shopping $$$ issue again.

I am thrilled at the 30 plus pounds of weight loss! I can deal with the side effects to have this impossible to lose weight off of me. I am a Nurse Practitioner who has always eaten healthy and exercised 5-7 times per week with NO success ever. Only a severe keto restricted diet took off a few pounds a couple of years ago, but it was impossible to keep up after 6 months of 26 carbs per day limit.

These medicines are life saving. Start slow, eat right and exercise. You will lose weight. It is a miracle in my opinion. Tell your doctors, Nurse Practitioners and friends about these meds.

Another study has shown a reduction in fatal and non-fatal heart attacks AND strokes with Ozempic (Wegovy is the same exact medicine). I put my husband on a small dose of it for his Diabetes, his sugars are 20 points lower and his A1C is now normal for the first time in 20 years. He is still on his Metformin too. Both of our blood pressure levels and triglycerides are in the normal range now.

Don't give up!"

My A1C kept climbing as well no matter how much I changed my diet. I went up to 2000mg of Metformin and it made me vomit every morning. The next step was insulin. I learned about Mounjaro through a coworker that was using it for weight loss. I started Mounjaro in November 2022 doing the 2.5mg increments every 4 weeks. At the end of January, my A1C went down over 2 points and I lost 20lbs. 
It’s not end of April 2023 and I’ve lost over 30lbs and my blood sugars are normal even when I cheat and have a sugar snack or drink once in a while. 
I have moved up to the 15mg but had horrible diarrhea and had to drop down to 10mg to give my body a break for a couple of weeks. 
Some pointers to avoid side effects. 
Don’t over eat the day before or day of taking your injection. 
For heartburn and sulfur burps, take gas x and omeprazole as directed. 
Avoid eating heavy meals later in the day. Pay attention to which foods cause you GI symptoms.

Plan to increase to 7.5 for weeks 9 - 12.  Severely obese with HBP, pre-diabetic, high A1C.  Starting weight 234 and I'm down to 210.  Injection is painless for me.  A bit of constipation and maybe some dry mouth, but overall side effects have been very minimal.  Happy with results and feeling healthier already.  I think the way I feel about food on this medication might be the way normal people feel about food all thetime.  It's been shocking to not have cravings, not be starving and not want to eat ALL the cookies.  It's been hard to manage getting the Rx because my doctor has been very hands off and doesn't seem interested in helping me manage this journey.  I plan to have labs done in a couple more weeks to check A1C etc and at that time will have a doctor visit to discuss and ask questions.  I think this drug is new enough that my doc doesn't have any experience with it. So far this has been a game changer for me.  I'm watching what I eat and exercising more, but the difference is that I can manage the food part of this about 1000 times better than I have ever been able to on previous weight loss regimens.  I feel like I can be successful.  Hoping there are no negative long term side effects and that insurance will cover in future for weight loss.  I won't say how much I've been paying per month, but decided I was worth it for 4 months at least if it was working for me.  It has helped me see the portions I should be eating and made me even more aware of food choices so I'm hopeful that I can continue these healthy norms even if I have to stop taking the MJ."

I weighed approx. 185 at the time. Within two weeks, I knew this application was not right for me. I have at times had the feeling of appetite suppression naturally and as a result of medication, however, this drug seemed to take it to another level. I didn't want food at all, which if you've had experience with needing to lose weight, it's not the way to go. I didn't lose anything in 30 days. Symptom-wise, not much while taking the initial dose of 2.5mg, apart from two incidences of no warning vomiting, and unfortunate for me, these both happened while away from home. The worse of the symptoms came after I stopped. For about 10 days, I had gastro intestinal issues. I also didn't lose any weight; but seemed to gain after coming off of it. I did seek to give Mounjaro one more try thinking maybe it was just the way the first month goes for some, maybe my body calibrating, but when I returned to my doctor, he had no more samples left, and I didn't feel based on the experience/results, that it was worth $1,300.00 to see if another 30 days would make a difference. Also, I remained hydrated through the first month. This is just my experience, but I would rather do the Mediterranean diet, be healthy, be good to my body, then punish it. If it works for you, for health issues especially, terrific! But if it doesn't, find another way. They are out there!"

I had blood work taking at week 4 and my A1c is up to 10.5??  Which is crazy becuz I can barely eat. Before taking it, I wasn’t a big eater but I’ve been chunky for awhile. 200lbs at 5’7 I’m 47. I have not lost a single pound but I’ve lost my appetite so I’m down to 1 small meal a day. I don’t get much exercise due to other aliments. I’m just wondering if something else is going on? The loss of appetite isn’t a big deal to me, I just don’t understandwhy the weight isn’t coming off? When I took Trulicity for 3 months I lost 15lbs but it all came back on after I stopped it. I don’t know if my hypothyroidism’s is causing this or what. Those levels are very high too. I’m wondering if my doctor ups the Mounjaro maybe that will help. ( I’m still on the 2.5 mg). Oh, the diarrhea and nausea is only bad when I eat rich meals or red meat. I’m honing to schedule another appointment soon to see what doctor says. Id love to know if anyone else is experiencing something similar."

I have never had any Diabetes medicine work this well for me, so well I'm no longer on any insulin whatsoever. I have lost 25 lbs. I'm now taking 10 mg. I take my shot on Monday I know the side effects are gonna be bad Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. There is a lot of stomach upset with it. I also have itchy redness at the injection. I deal with the side effects because I felt hopeless being a Diabetic before.Mounjaro has helped so much. My blood sugars are in range all the time. My A1C is down.

I did the first 2 months at 2.5mg then moved up to the 5mg dose.  I did lose about 20lbs, however there were times I thought I was going to just die.  I was barely able to eat anything much at all without horrible gas and bloating.  At night is when the demons came with the diarrhea like water and dry heaving for hours.  I just say on the toilet with the wastebasket, and was so light headed o could hardly make it back to my bed. I took my last injection 2 weeks ago, I actually have the remaining 2 pens to my husband to throw away, he did so gladly! My Dr wants to try me on the latest medication Wegovy now.  I've just read some of the same horror stories so I'm reconsidering picking it up from pharmacy.

It did not reduce my appetite at all. So the 2nd week my doctor said I can go up to 5mg. I went up to 5mg and I was so sick. I had horrible diarrhea and then my vomiting was awful. I skipped two weeks of getting injections because my vomiting was so bad. So the 5th week I went back and the doctor said she would give me 2.5mg and then gave me another 2.5mg shot to take home and give it a few days after the first shot. This helped reduce my appetite but again, I was vomiting 3-4 days out of the week. I was so nauseated, I had bad acid reflux which I never had before Monjauro and I was miserable. I figured my body just needed to get adjusted to it. I did this a couple of more weeks and was still so sick, 3-4 days of vomiting. I changed my eating habits and focused on proteins and healthier options. I made the decision I am not going to destroy my body taking these injections when my body just can't handle them. I am going to use the tools I learned over these 8 weeks to continue making healthier eating choices, drink tons of water and exercise. I am bummed that the injections did not work for me but I am not going to spend my time vomiting, having constant nausea, diarrhea and all of that has interrupted my sleep and has affected my ability to do my job as well. I will find another way to get this weight off and it won't be with Monjauro."

First, Monjauro has worked great for me. I have struggled with my weight and diabetes for a while. And I have finally been able to lose the weight and my diabetes has been lowered. Second, I had one pen injection release by accident. The company replaced it with no issues. They could not have been nicer and more accommodating regarding it. I am very happy with this product.

I was on Ozempic for over a year and could no longer tolerate the GI side affects.  They were terrible.  I was excited to try another medication.  I started on the 2.5 dose on a Tuesday night.  By Thursday afternoon I had GI side affects.  It started with sulfer burps and then progressed to throwing up, diarrhea, stomach cramping, dizziness, light sensitivity.  I had no desire for food and couldn't even stand the smell ofit.  It has been a week and I have been reduced to eating oatmeal and saltine crackers just so that I can function without being in the bathroom constantly.  Today I found out that this medicine can stay in your system for 25-30 days after you stop taking it.  It has already been the longest week of my life.

This drug feels dangerous. Not only did it raise my Thyroid TSH from .91 to 2.48 in only 2 months but my acid reflux is uncontrollable. Prilosec is doing nothing for how bad mounjaro messes up your stomach  and I’m afraid of getting pancreatitis like others or worse thyroid issues causing permanent weight problems. I have only lost 9 pounds in 3 months. I have been eating properly and working out when I don’t feel like total crap from this medicine. I enjoy feeling in control of my food choices and not having sugar cravings but I don’t think that is worth the long term problems this medicine is causing. I learned my lesson from HCG and I’m not riding this wave anymore to find out. I have had headaches (only with 10), horrible acid reflux, with 10mg being to the point of stomach acid constantly coming up in my mouth, lightheaded and feeling like I’m going to pass out on all mg. The appetite suppressant is so strong that it’s counterproductive because I’m not able to eat what I should which is only going to mess with my hormones and metabolic resistance more. I would be very careful taking this if it’s not actually necessary. Not everybody loses mass amounts of weight and not being able to function in the process or ending up with more health issues is not worth it."

Insulin resistance!  Weight gain increased every year.  267 lbs. before my Endocrinologists first prescribed Mounjaro. lost 37 lbs. over first 12 weeks.  High A1C before.  At one point my A1C was 12.  Average A1C was 8.5 to 9.5.  1st 4 weeks dosage was 2.5 mg.  Next 8 weeks using 5 mg.  Recent labs with a result of 6.6.  WOW!  Craving for carbs disappeared.  Eating smaller portions and the foods I once craved 
 (Carbs & desert, etc.) are no longer what I want, nor eat.  Endocrinologist increased my dosage to 7.5 mg for the next 4 weeks.  He will increase dosage to 10 or 12.5 mg after a 4 week review.  My insulin usage was high before starting Maounjaro.  Have reduced daily units of both Levimer and NovaLog.  Reduced NovaLog by as much as 100 units/day.  I've also noticed great improvements in my digestive track.  Prescription stool softer once prescribed is no longer required.  I feel ALIVE now.

Shortly after, Ozempic was hard to fill at my pharmacy and I had gone weeks without it.  It was sporadic at best. Fortunately Mounjaro came along and I was able to get it fulfilled with no problems. On Ozempic, I successfully lost 40 lbs. I had no symptoms. Once I began taking Mounjaro, I felt body aches on the first does for a day, after that, it's been smooth sailing. I have reached my one year point and I am down 100 lbs. I am a 52 year old male, Asian/Pacific Islander decent. You need to make better choices with food consumption or it will not effectively work for you. This has been a lifesaver for me. I have lost a sibling and my father to complications from type 2 diabetes, I did not want to face the same faith. Having changed my diet has made a world of difference. I no longer am sluggish. I no longer have a craving for sugar, I no longer need starch with every meal. I have portion controlled my food but have not stop eating what I enjoy, just not excessively. It's a fantastic drug that has made have a new outlook on life, I no longer dread waking daily and have no issues feeling drowsy during the daytime. I feel fortunate to not have any ill side effects, I hope those of you debating on weather or not to give Mounjaro a try, that you give it your honest attempt. You rarely if ever fell the shot, it's quick and painless, I am not kidding you either. My biggest recommendation is to stay hydrated! You would not believe how well your body will work if you stay hydrated. If you are dehydrated, recognize and replenish. Wishing all of you success in your journey."

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,2/23/2023,KikiAnna,55-64,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I have been on this drug since October 11th 2022. It is now February of 2023 and I have lost over 50 lbs. I have found throughout the entire journey of this that it's been incredibly easy to lose weight but I did completely change my eating habits. Because of my type 2 diabetes I am now raw sugar free and I eat low to no carbs. That change in itself I'm sure would have helped me lose weight as I had lost about 14 lb prior to starting on Mounjaro. I started off with the lowest dose and I have only gone to 5 mg and no matter how much I eat right now I am continuing to lose weight. I am not trying to I wanted to try and maintain where I got to. I went from 174 lb to 124 lb and I really don't want to lose anymore. Though I do have to stay on this because of my diabetes I need to learn how to eat more calorically so that that does not feel my stomach up. I can't take eating too much at one time because of the way that the medication works. It is a very good thing but I have noticed now I look like a melted candle and I will need surgery to remove the extra skin. It's not a lot but it is very ugly. I am 61 years old, 5'3"" tall, so I don't have as much collagen and elasticity in my body. I did find a surgeon but now I have to try and come up with $25,000 to get this performed. I don't know where that's going to come from. Check with your insurances before you think they will pay for this. Most of them do not.
I would recommend this injection but with caution. Do it slowly, because that way you may be able to have your skin shrink back more than what mine has not. And I do understand it has to do with my age, but it also has to do with how quickly this weight came off of me. I did start working out also when I started this and it has definitely given me more muscle, but I think this drug eats fat also. But there isn't enough information on what this does to your entire body. And in saying that I do realize that I am one of the guinea pigs for this new type 2 diabetes medication.

As of today, I am down 36lbs, which is wonderful! I have struggled with my weight since I was a child and I am now 44. I have done ""all"" the diets and had success with most. Mounjaro has been amazing at lowering my appetite and sugar cravings. I am no longer sneaking food, late night snacks or binge eating. I have had mild injection site irritation. I am currently on week 3 of the 7.5mg injection and the side effects have been awful. The first weekI chalked it up to the dose step, the second week the day after my injection I was dizzy, nauseated and had a general malaise feeling. The third 7.5mg injection I totally had to stay in bed the day after. I was so dizzy I couldn't even drive. I have an appointment with my PCP to discuss and hopefully go back down to the 5mg injection since I love the results but can't tolerate the side effects. I can counter act the constipation, deal with the waves of nausea but the dizziness is awful and I don't know what to do. I drink protein shakes, take vitamins and drink 64-98oz of water daily.

I am a nurse and I watched my doctor lose an amazing amount of weight on this before I started it. The main take away here is you can always stop taking it if it doenst work for you or if you feel the side effects are too much so why not give it a try? I will admit the energy level bothers me I simply have none and when you lose weight that should increase not decrease this medication does make you very tired so once I do lose enough I will go off of it even though my doctor thinks a maintenance dose might be needed..I feel energy is needed."

Also, finally, validated that I have PCOS (my doc diagnosed me before the name was normalized many years ago). LOVE this drug. 

The food noise is gone, not feeling hungry all the time. Also observed, I'm calmer and less moody and less stressed. Also observed my mind is more clear, less foggy and I have more energy. I've lost almost 10 lbs in the first week on 2.5mg. The second week is focused on breaking habits, like snacking at a certain time. This drug has transformed my life and I am feeling normal again. I don't binge because I'm afraid I won't get to eat carbs. I also don't have the urge to binge either. I get fully pretty fast. I didn't experience the side-effects others mentioned but am prepared as my dosage goes up. 

I wish insurance would cover the drug for obesity/insulin resistance, since my BMI was 37 and hedging on morbid obesity. I'm paying cash, full price as insurance doesn't cover the drug for my situation. Insurance does cover the drug 100% with a diabetes diagnosis (sad they want us to have a deadly illness vs help prevent, but it's another topic)."

I recently had a routine Endoscopic procedure thatwas stopped early in the process becuase the doctor found food still in my stomach (mind you, I had not eaten solid food 2 days prior and I STILL had food in my stomach).

I lost almost 100 pounds on Rybelsus, which at first was great for decreasing appetite, but after several months, my appetite returned, along with the sugar cravings.
If I keep my calories around 1000 and exercise everyday, I lose, but if I try to just maintain, the scales go right back up.
In the last year, I've put on almost 40 of the 100 lost. Mounjaro was mylast hope, as I've already tried Ozempic with no luck.

The first day or so after my injection I have been a bit nauseous and have heartburn. The nausea passes and a daily omeprezole fixes the heartburn. Fatigue is probably the worst symptom for me. But on the flip side my arthritis has improved exponentially. I noticed after about a month that my hands were no longer as swollen and painful as they used to be.

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,1/22/2023,Adam,45-54,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,5,1,0,"50 year old male. Had bariatric sleeve surgery in June ‘20. Went for 341 to 238 in 10 months. My pre-surgery goal was 225lbs. Covid came, stuck at home, parents moved in, sold houses, moved to a different state, yadda yadda. This past Sep I had my physical where I had gone back up to 274. 
Heard about Mounjaro. Tried a sample at 2.5 mg. Made me feel like I did post surgery. Had to make it a point to get 1000-1500 calories in me a day. Today, Jan 22 2023 I weighed in at 224.9lbs. Finally made mygoal weight. So roughly 50lbs in 5 months (now at 10mg). I was told that on the bell curve of results, my level of weight loss usually takes a year. Has it worked so well because of my prior surgery? I don’t know. Like I wrote it has rekindled my the lack of appetite I had post surgery. It’s been life changing. 

Easy of use: Keep refrigerated. Once a week take out pen, take off cap, turn head one half rotation, put on muffin top next to belly button. Hold down plunger until you hear a click. Throw out pen and go about your day. 
Pain of injection: Nonexistent. The first time I administered the drug I thought I messed up because I didn’t feel anything. Pin head blood dot was the only proof I had done it right.
Side effects: Only thing I can notice is I can only go number 2 once or twice a week. Don’t feel constipated, just don’t need to go. Could be the amount of food intake. 

Summation: It’s almost too good to be true. Again, I don’t know if my level success is based off of my prior bariatric surgery or not. If Mounjaro can continue their success, it will make bariatric surgery obsolete."

The very next day I am immediately noticed I wasn’t hungry, which is unusual and welcome. This has really helped me be very healthy in my eating and knowing I was on it made me resist times to overeat that I would have. I have medicare and private company insurance so I thought I would have to pay full price but was going to try a month anyway as it is so very hard for me to lose any weight. When I mentioned to the Walgreen pharmacist that I hadthe Lily coupon but I knew I was not eligible (retired, 69) he said let me see it, sometimes it helps some anyway and it knocked price down to $450! I was so excited! Only side effect has been minor “heartburn” like symptoms and light headaches I think are from low calories. I have been eating Nutritarian for 10 years anyway but now cutting out the bread and cheese (ugh) I had snuck in. Near end of week 2. Start 191, now 184, bg 85.

That said I am down from a dress/pants size if 16 to a size 8 now! Yesssssss.  I have only ever had one side effect ::: the itchy welt that gets red at injection site it lasts all weekand it is insanely itchy. Crazy crazy maker itchy. Sometimes it shows up right away some times it takes 8-24 hours to show up but it is max max max itchy and so uncomfortable. Also the pen sucks so much. I hate the injection pen with a vengence. It’s awful!! There is no need for this over wrought contraption. The Ozempic pen was small and discreet and easy to carrry in purse. It also was not painful. This mounjaro pen HURTS! And it’s clunky and huge! I hate it. Ok well anyway. I am down to 156lbs now from 210. I am on week 4 of 10mg. And I have to say the past three weeks after injection I have had a horrendous horrendous experience with “food poisoning like” violent vomit. VIOLENT vomiting. Throwing up water even. It’s insane. Now I don’t know if it was actual food poisoning the first week on 10mg. So the next weeek it happens again and I think maybe it was stomach flu. And then third week was last week and I think maybe. It was the recall on a product I consumed. I just took my 4th 10mg shot today three hours ago. 

I am already feeling slightly nauseous and have had a BM and some loose stool. So now drinking water. The itchy welt hasn’t shown up yet on my thigh. I’m waiting to see if I have the vomit reaction again this weekend or god willing it doesn’t happen. I would really hate to have to stop taking this medication as it is life changing and a god send. Truly. 

I have PCOS and close to fifty and have not been able to lose the weight thru diet and exercise and I can not tolerate stimulant drugs like Phentermine. They are awful. Please god I hope. I don’t get sick on this. ???????????????? please let this work this week without getting deathly sick. If I do- I will ask to go back down to 7.5mg. Or 5mg. Whatever it takes. Also I am taking naltrexone and bupropion daily for weightloss as well but really not sure how much either of those do anything for the weightloss. I’ll tell ya though I noticed that some dairy products always smell spoiled to me. Even when. They are not. So that is weird. That might be from the meds or it could be a side effect from Covid I read tho I never tested positive for Covid nor have I ever had it from what I can tell. 

I’ll post an update after this weeekend to see if I am able to survive the battle of vomit and diarrhea. Wish me luck. ??"

I am baffled at the results! My blood sugar has leveled off and is no longer spiking and dropping, my blood pressure has also stopped responding to uncontrolled BS levels and is back to normal, and I have lost 12.4 lbs this month. 
I have not had the [horrible] side effects that many people have reported but I have noticed a difference in my energylevel overall since I began taking this medication. I am often sluggish and fatigued. Coconut water (4oz) daily to replace electrolytes seems to be helping.

I have PCOS and Insulin Resistance and weight loss has been a struggle for me for a long time.  I'm very active and eat relatively healthy however sugar cravings take over.  My doctor wanted me to try this medication. I went from 215lbs to 149lbs.  I have had fatty liver for over 10 years and after my most resent abdominal CT it's totally gone.  I am currently taking 12.5mg however I will be going back to 2.5mg for maintenance.  This has been a game changer for me.  I know people get upset about non-diabetics taking this medication however there are people out there with other ailments that this drug can help. This drug can be used to prevent Type 2 diabetes.  I'm happy for anyone that can take this and change their lives.  It should be noted that you have to be committed to a lifestyle change.  Yes this medication helps you lose weight easily and quickly however if you don't watch what your eating and continue to exercise the weight loss will only be temporary.  This is a great tool to get you on track.  Don't look at is as an easy way to get thin.  (Just my advise)

This is the ONLY medication that has ever helped and I am so upset andsad that I can no longer take.

Started First Dose.

Almost within an hour felt a lower sense of hunger.
But out of habit, I ate my normal size dinner a few hours later and felt bloated, almost nauseous.

Then, Friday nite had rib eye, salad & whiskey.  Later that nite, I felt ill - very ill, on the verge of puking. 

Sat, tired very low energy, not sure if it's the shot.  Sunday, I ate much less than normal portions, still a little sick.  Even skipped lunch, as was not in the mood. Felt better.

Thiscontinued off/on til the second shot.  Then I realized the sick feelings were due to consuming massive quantities of food, fat & alcohol.  Once I reduced this to half of what i was used to (it took a few weeks to achieve), I was no longer sick if I consumed smaller amounts.  And cut back on alcohol.

Does this shot reduce drinking too??  

It's now been six weeks.  I've lost 12 POUNDS.  My energy is increasing.  Even though I'm eating Half of what I used to (and better-balanced meals) food really tastes better than before.  And without dreaming about what I was going to eat from my waking moment to nite time.

The side effects are:
You will be ill if you overeat and drink, in various ways, on various days.
Constipation made me adjust food to include more fiber, eating dates, etc.  
Burping more than normal, but no big deal.
- A few days here and there, had diarrhea, minor headaches, and some of the symptoms others have listed, BUT, they all go away or reduce as soon as I adjusted my intake.

Two Days before the next shot, My desire to eat increases a little.

I've tried to step up to the 5 mg, but everyone is sold out ....nationwide. Yes, called all around the country.

At first, I was frustrated by that, but I realized that today's scarcity will increase supply and it will lower prices as well.

I need to lose 60 lbs to eliminate my diabetes & Meds & CPAP.
I've felt this was an impossible goal in the last ten years.
I'm now down 12 lbs and I can see the reality of getting my life back to some prior normalcy.  
And I don't want to Die.

I can see not even having to use this med in the future as well.

I really want to go to the next (5mg) level.  
This is a life changer."

My ankles and feet swell and my joints just hurt. I weighed 211lbs when I went to the Dr. 2 months ago asking for help. I'd never heard of mounjaro and was expecting phentermine (that was prescribed to me in the past). She put me on the 2.5mg. Prior to using, when i would wake up the first thought went to food, but afterthe 1st dose it was like a switch flicked and my cravings and appetite did a 180°..the 2nd,3rd, and 4th dose side effects were intense to say the least..I take my dose Saturday night, the Sunday after was BRUTAL, I literally stayed in bed and slept the whole day because just opening my eyes made my head hurt and the nausea was unimaginable..I seriously considered discontinuing the medicine, the side effects did get less severe and the last 2 weeks I didn't experience any of the discomfort I had before...I think your body just has to adjust and everyone is different..I have to FORCE myself to eat now and I'm only able to get down about a half cup of whatever it is..I have found (if your having trouble eating) that eating bland foods is easiest to get down (crackers, toast etc.,) and I've also not had trouble eating fresh fruits and veggies..but anything sugary or salty is a NOGO. I go back to my dr. Jan. 6th for an ""official"" weigh-in but I'm down from 211 to 190 in less than 2 months and haven't had a single flair up from my auto immune issue....hope this helps. And I pray Eli Lily doesn't restrict non-diabetics...being overweight can cause diabetes, its not just a treatment after you get diabetes, its  preventive care to stop it before it happens..obesity is a HUGE problem in America..this is a game changer.

I love not having to take pills like when I was on metformin. This is definitely a game changer.
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,12/10/2022,Carrie,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,4,4,4,4,1,0,My A1C was 11 taking 5 shots of insulin a day before I started Mounjaro. I am supposed to increase to start taking 7.5 dose but the pharmacy is back ordered due to everyone using for weight loss. My A1C is under 9 which it hasn't been in YEARS. I hope that it can go on the FHC formally in June after coupon won't work. This is really working for me!!!! I am down from A1C 11 to 8.5 so far in only 2 months.

I was on 5mg for 2 months then my Dr prescribed 7.5mg 3 weeks ago. We all know they've been out so I haven't had any in 4 weeks. Dr sent in prescription for 12.5 and I started today. Even on the 5mg I wouldn't feel very good the day I took it but I'm pretty sure I shouldn't have gone from 5mg to none for 4 weeks to 12.5mg because I feel horrible! I've thrown up 3 times today. I took it at 11am it's 830pm. I'm not going to continue thisstrength. It's too much for me.

I had already lost 28 lbs since 6/28/22 but could NOT get past the 28 lb loss no matter what I did. Dr. prescribed 2.5 dose for 4 weeks. GAME CHANGER! Now I hear that Eli Lilly cracking down on prescriptions unless for diabetes. Praying this is not the case. This has taken away cravings and anxious eating habits and I’ve lost a total now of 37 lbs. Could not have done it without Mounjaro, honestly believe. Please Eli Lilly, DO NOT DO AWAY WITH DISCOUNT CARD for obesity OR diabetes! One is related to the other !"

Any swelling I had in my body is completely gone.  This stuff can be life saving for so many people.  Highly recommend."

I did have a couple headaches here and there, but the worst thing I experienced was bad acid reflux and some dizziness. I am down to 125 pounds. I do not plan to use any longer as I lost the weight I needed to. I started on 2.5 and then 5.0 and then 7.5. It is WELL worth anyone to use that needs to lose weight and then they can exercise and keep it off once you no longer take the medicine. I personally know about 15-20 people that take the medicine for weight loss andthey all have lost weight. I have only had 2 friends get very sick when they took the 7.5."

But the side effects, I don't know if its worth it. I am on 7.5 and have been taking it for 9 weeks. I have migraines the first few days after the shot. These are debilitating migraines. Then I have nerve pain in my left foot. It started out as just a small spot. Each shot increases the area of the pain. The whole top of my left foot, side of ankle and now the back of my whole left calf. My clothes rub against it and I just cry in pain. I can push againstit and not move and there is no pain but the light rubbing, its excruciating pain. So keep taking it and have it possibly spread and get worse, but have my A1C keep going down, lose more weight, get off my cholesterol medication OR get rid of the nerve pain and migraine and keep the weight-well keep fighting it, stay on medication for cholesterol and struggle with my A1C.

I love that I don't have eating disorder thoughts all the time or think about food a lot. I have childhood trauma and that has led me to be overweight my whole life.Losing weight makes me anxious, but I'm working through it with my therapist and nutritionist.

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,12/1/2022,M Saunders,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5,5,5,5,1,0,This medication has changed my life. It has changed my relationship with food and allowed me to train my mind what is enough. I never would have been able to do it on my own. I tried and it never worked.
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,12/1/2022,AA1 in Georgia,45-54,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,2,1,3,2,1,0,"I am a 46 year old B/F and I have completed my first 4 injections of Mounjaro 2.5mg. 

I am a full-time police officer and have a moderately active life. I have followed my physician’s instructions to the letter because I want this to work for my health not simply for weight loss. 

Before beginning Mounjaro, I was on a steady loss and was down 9 pounds in one month (from my last office visit) doing nothing outside of my normal routine of eating lean protein, large amounts of raw vegetables andfruits (strawberries, blueberries, apples, oranges, and grapefruit only), drinking half my body weight in ounces of water, and walking/jogging 2.5 miles 5 days a week.

This method has helped me lose a total of 85 lbs from Dec 2019 to December 2021. I gained 30 pounds back plateauing out and maintaining 220-225 pounds (size 14 women’s clothing 36-38W in men’s law enforcement clothing). 

However, I was been fighting sugar cravings and having a hard time staying [full] after eating before I felt like I was starving again. I was gaining belly fat which is unusual for me. I was falling asleep at weird times throughout the day and having swelling in my legs and feet with numbness in my arms and hands. 

After trying several methods to treat my symptoms, which point to diabetes, my doctor decided to try me on Mounjaro.

Many of her patients have shown outstanding results. They also have side effect horror stories that made me a little skeptical… and nervous to be honest.

I, on the other hand, can not share the success stories so far. Where others lost between 12 - 17 pounds in the first month, and lowered their A1C. 

I have gained two pounds and my labs are the same. After being on a steady loss, I am a bit disappointed BUT I did not experience the ongoing series of side effects that they had either! Thankfully.

My digestive system stopped working normally after the first injection. I did not have a BM for 2 days! Uh, NO. 

Typically, I have normal, regular bowel movements shortly after eating a meal and urinate out the correct amount of fluids from what I take in. I am now urinating twice as much and my bowel movements declined to small and not as frequent. I am experiencing dehydration now, too. 

I increased my (raw or ground) ginger intake and added prunes to my diet every morning and evening. This has helped tremendously with getting my regularity back to normal. 

I have had no other “expected” side effects outside of the digestive issues but I do have very specific food cravings that I never had before. Now my sweet craving is chocolate candy with caramel and my new, completely weird craving is chicken (fried) fillet sandwich with mustard…. What is this??? I absolutely have not experienced loss of appetite! 

I get tired easily and can barely complete my 2.5 ml walks. Jogging is completely out of the question since the first injection.

After my visit Tuesday (11-29-2022) my physician decided to increase me to the 5 mg dose. I’m willing to try one more month but if I don’t see improvement, I will not be continuing this medication for a third month. 

I am fairly disappointed with my results overall."

Side effects are a little achy day of shot ( like the flu) and loss of cravings or any thoughts of food at all. First month I had a headache which subsided. 
I highly recommend speak to your gp."

Lipids are controlled effectively with 70mg of repatha. (I throw away half the repatha dose bc it dropped my ldl to 36 with nerve pain)  I just got new labs. Currently taking 5mg dose of mounjaro. Hemoglobin a1c is 7.1. Triglycerides 92. Weight loss over 3 months 8 lbs.  I also am maxed out on jardiance and metformin and 52 units of long acting insulin. C peptide results show I make plenty of insulin.  I believe my large waist and fatty liver are largely responsible for my insulin resistance. I also have dawn syndrome...again liver issues. Also believe I had undiagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome for years.  My irregular periods miraculously became regular at 38 when I was started on metformin
 
This new drug has given me the best results for my insulin resistance overall to date. Some nausea and burping that pass after second day following dosing.

binge extremely hard, then starve myself the next day. I would think about food every minute, every second, looking at the clock wondering when I can eat again (even when i wasn’t hungry). I couldn’t study, sometimesI couldn’t complete task because I thought about food, when I was bored, i’d binge. I was a restrict/binge cycle. This medicine neurologically cured me. I can stay at home all day and trust I won’t binge. I can complete task now. I can study, my grades have significantly increased, I can focus.

Lots of nausea and general gastric uneasiness.  Takes away appetite to the point that I don't eat and can't recognize hunger symptoms until I get weak with hunger.

Start weight 245
Current weight 230
Start A1C 7.0

I started Mounjaro at the 2.5 dose. Week 2 I noticed my appetite had subsided tremendously and when I ate,  I had to be careful or I would feel overly full. I had no side effects until after my 3rd weeks dose. Then I had terrible diarrhea and cramping with gas, bloating and belching. It cleared up after 3 days and I thought maybe I caught a flu bug. I missed my follow up appointment so I couldn't get a refill and had to go off themedicine for 3 weeks and start over again at the 2.5 dose. 
The second time on 2.5, I had no side effects but I also felt no difference in my appetite like the first time on the drug. I was still overly hungry being on a diet so my next visit, my doctor increased me to 5.0 and I was excited! Until week 2. 

Again, I suffered the same side effects for a full 4 days!! I had to switch to a liquid diet until it finally cleared up today. I've been taking Imodium AD as well. I think I'm ready to try toast tomorrow. 

Now I see why so many people lose weight on this drug! I went 4 days with less than 500 calories per day and still keeping my full work routine at a very physical job. 

I'm not sure if it's really worth the weight loss but I'm going to try and continue because getting rid of my diabetes is extremely important."

I have noticed a decrease in appetite, lost weight and at 2 inches from my waste. Despite the terrible things that may happen with the drug, thyroid cancer, it very important to lower my AC1 and not be tagged with the TYPE 2 designation which can result in unfavorable life insurance premiums.

My doc moved me up to 5 mg and I still had no side effects at all and my A1C still was above 6. In September I stayed on 5 mg with no weight loss and no side effects and out of control A1C.  My doc changed my dose to 7.5 mg and all hell started up the first week. You name a side effectI had it and my weight dropped 5lbs the first 3 days. The 2nd week the day of my injection all side effects went away except the weird sense of fullness. All my life I have never felt the full feeling everyone else seems to have. Now I get it.  My diet before all this has been Keto to control my type 2 without insulin. I now eat so much less and feel full immediately.  It is nice to have my body working for me now.  I lost an additional 5 for a total of 10 for the 2 weeks I seem to be on the right dose now. My home A1C test shows 5.5. So I seem to be coming back to the Victoza level before starting all this.

I’m able to eat about 1/3 or less of the normal amount of food I was eating and I wasn’t eating more than 2,250 calories a day before medication. Due to medical conditions I have and other medications I’m on, I was not able to lose weight after initially losing 100lbs on my own. I’m now at 5mg injections and 26 pounds down at 5 weeks. 
This medication isn’t a magical fix. But it gives you the chance and time to make change by lowering your hunger, to find healthy foods you like that will fill you up. So you can stick with it for the long run. It gives you the ability to create a healthy lifestyle. This medication has changed my life. The only issues I’ve had are headaches, severe nausea and cramping mainly after eating heavy or larger portions of food. The benefits outweigh the side effects for me. Also if you are struggling to get this medication paid for by insurance have your doctor send it to a specialty pharmacy or have your pharmacy apply the mounjaro saving card for a years worth at $25 a month. It’s worth it."

I also practice mostly keto and some intermittent fasting to help keep my weight under control.  I started this drug 12 weeks ago and progressed each month from 2.5 mg up to 7.5mg moving to 10mg (next month and will stay there for 6 months), I've already lost 30lbs. With little to no side effects other than not really being hungry. I wasn't really hungry post gastric bypass but I still liked to eat.

I am a little dizzy from time to time.  Came to this site to see if others feel as great as I do after only one injection. Not sure how or why it has helped mood.  Didn’t know my mood needed help.  I thought my actual antidepressant was working fine.  But dang this stuff is amazing.  I wonder if it is positively interacting with my Wellbutrin and Trintellix.   Side note: zero desire to eat.  Dry mouth.  But nothing so bad as to worry or stop taking.  I really hope benefits of mood stay.

My blood sugar went from the 3 hundreds down to The low hundreds. I haven't experienced any insight effects that I know of. I am absolutely Is esthetic about this medication. I also am not eating anything with sugar at all so that probably has a bit to do with the extra weight loss.
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,10/18/2022,Jutes,65-74,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,5,5,5,5,1,0,"This is my first week. I am 66 female, 5'5"" 186 starting weight. Hb high cholesterol prediabetic etc. After reading reviews I was nervous about side effects - asked doc for zofran just in case of nausea. No need so far
Injection was easier than taking pill. No pain. First 2 days even thought of food made me queasy. No other side effects! I am taking Metamucil every day to protect against constipation. I do have daily diahhera but prob from Metamucil. I force myself to eat small portions of foodsuch as half hard boiled egg, half cup applesauce. Drink meal replacement every am. No appetite.
Some muscle pain but since I am drinking soo much water I assume it's electrolyte imbalance. Add salt half teaspoon of sugar to cup of water to alleviate - it helps. 
I am beyond happy so far. Just to have my obsession with food gone is a relief. Eat to live not live to eat. It is only costing me 50.00 per week with insurance so far - when dose goes up hope price doesn't go with it. Just moving around bending over etc has been so hard at my obese weight. I want to feel better and be healthier - this isn't about vanity. Type 2 diabetes is a family curse. If you can afford this medication try it."

Only negative is constipation the week I up the dose.  Going to 7.5 next week.   I am very pleased with this medication.   It is easy to administer.  I have to remember to eat.  Food tastes great, but need to eat small meals. Lost all cravings.   I consider this like a chemical gastric bypass.  If I overeat, I do feel ill.  Make sure you eat 3 meals a day, just smaller meals.  I am staying around 1200 cals a day.    Mydaughter is starting on Mounjaro soon after seeing my happiness with it."

I started mine at 5mg at the beginning of august.
At first I seemed to have lost 5-7lbs. But now I am on dose 10 and feel as though I’ve gained weight. 
My body typically needs the higher dose of things to have it work effectively. 
I only experienced the loss of appetite one week out of the 10 weeks I’ve been on it. I’m hoping it all starts to work once I up my dose more. 
I wish we could comment to each other on here"
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,10/16/2022,Tom G,55-64,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,4.333333333333333,5,5,3,,1,"I just finished week 16 on Mounjaro.  2.5mg for 4 weeks; 5.0mg for 4 weeks; 7.5mg for 4 weeks; and I just finished 4 weeks at 10mg.  I'm moving to 12.5mg for 4 weeks and then finally to the final 15.0mg for however long I have to stay on this stuff.

16 weeks in and I've dropped from 279 to 258.  That part feels great.  Fairly consistent 1-2 lbs per week.  My appetite is way down, I have to force myself to eat.

Side effects for me at the 2.5-7.5mg dosage were negligible, only real thing was lack of appetite.  However, since I've been at 10mg, my injection day side effects are considerable.  Brain fog, anxiety, increased heart rate, constipation, vomitting.  It starts about 6 hours after the injection and lasts the rest of the day.  I plan to change from injection first thing in the morning to late in the day, hoping that I sleep through most of those bad hours.  We'll see.

My concern is that if I'm having issues at 10mg, what will 12.5 and 15.0 be like.  I guess I'll find out.

My reason for taking this was to control my A1c and get off Metformin.  I was on 2000mg per day of Metformin, had terrible GI issues, and still had a 7.9 A1c.   I now take zero Metformin, and my A1c is already down to 6.4 and falling."
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,10/16/2022,USK,65-74,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,4,4,5,3,1,0,"Started in August2022 on 2.5mg with general practitioner prescribing only after sending several JAMA articles about this new drug. I have been on Victoza for several years and was getting tried of the daily injections and 150$ monthly price tag.  It had been very good at keeping my A1C at 5.4.   I also take 500mg of ER Metformin  
My weight had risen during COVID to 276 from 235. Not being able to swim a mile every other day and not changing my eating habits caused this. Stress was also a factor.    
During August at 2.5mg I had no side effects and none of the appetite suppression others talk about here.  My A1C went out of control to 6.1. My doc increased the dose to 5 mg after 4 weeks. I still did not have any side effects and no weight loss.  My 3rd A1C did drop to 5.9.  I am now on 7.5 week1 and continue to take 500mg metformin.  Now the side effects others mentioned have kicked in. Severe loss of appetite. I have been following a Keto diet with 50 g a day of carbs in form of veggies and some fruit. Still no weight loss. My body seems to be really stubborn.  I do have lots of energy. My job has me walking and on my feet 8 hours a day 3 miles a day. I am hoping that now that my appetite is down the weight will start to come down too. I will post again in a month a let you know"

Lots of water and fiber plus no dairy and greasy foods were all suggested by my prescribing Dr. It seems consistent with the reviews I’ve read from those with nausea cramps and fatigue. I’m hopeful with this medication because I am a serial yo yo dieter and I recognize I need a healthier relationship with food.

I am starting to have more of an appetite now, and its becoming harder to keep my calorie intake that low, but if I don't, I gain a lb or 2 back. I have had no side effects from the meds, which makes me wonder if I am really having any effects? Ionly have about 10-15 lbs to lose, so maybe the weight isn't coming off as fast for me because I am not really obese. ? IDK. I am going to stick with it though and hope that I continue to drop some more weight. My hope is that once I get skinny again, I might not need to continue taking meds, and maybe even reverse my type 2."
Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,10/14/2022,Anonymous,55-64,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I have been taking the lowest dose for 1 1/2 months. I have had no issues with side effects. The directions state to follow a healthy diet, drink a lot of water and exercise. I eat ""clean"" - no sugar, no processed foods, no simple carbs and no artificial sweeteners. I do HIIT 3 times a week. I always have water with me. My provider's instruction was to take small bites-eat slow; I think this helps with your stomach not dumping its contents into the small intestines which can cause gastric issues. I was also told to eat minimal fat. I have dysregulation of my appetite hormones and Mounjaro helps with that. I finally know what felling full is like and I am able to feel real hunger.  I feel my hormones are behaving like a ""normal"" person's hormones. I have ""break through"" food issues around day 5 so I am learning to ride that wave until it passes. I hope Lily puts this through to the FDA for more than a diabetic medication. And if so I hope the FDA approves it for alternative uses."

I’ve been on the lowest dosage for four weeks. The first two weeks it caused severe G.I. upset. It has severely suppress my appetite to where I can’t even eat. I try to drink as much water as possible and stick to shakes because solid foods make me gag. My fourth week because of my low calorie intake and lack of fluids I went into hypoglycemic shock. My view of the shot is if you can tolerate it and you can force yourself to eat anddrink fluids like you’re supposed to it probably works just fine. However I cannot continue the shot. I see a lot of good positive reviews and that’s great but I think as more and more people get on the shot for all types of reasons you’re going to see other issues with it.

I have just completed first week at 5mg after 4 weeks on 2.5mg. I am a 66 yr old female and I am now down 13lb in 5 weeks. I am very happy taking Mounjaro and have had few side effects. However, I do not believe my good results are entirely an accident, and are related to the intentional lifestyle changes I am working very hard and intentionally to follow. The reduction in appetite has allowed me to reduce my food consumption by what I estimate is 50% to 66%.Basically, I think I was previously just eating constantly, snacking all day, and eating way too much. I have also increased my daily exercise to at least 60+ min daily and push myself to drink 6 to 8 12oz glasses of water daily. My morning blood sugar is now consistently under 100 after starting at 170, so this is very exciting to me. I also avoid junk food and simple carbs. If I was not doing all this, I can easily see myself having gastro issues and headaches,from poor food choices or getting dehydrated. I understand that everyone can have adverse reaction to a certain med. Many years ago had a severe reaction to prednisone and had to stop. It was just not the right med for me. Mounjaro is working very well for me so far, in conjunction with my eating and exercise habit changes. Will update at the end of Oct."

I have been starving for long term usage info, maybe from someone who was in a clinical study but I still can't find it.  Maybe they sign something stating that they will not discuss their experience on social media in return for the free drugs and treatment?  Anyhow, even though I have more questions than answers, I'd like to share a tiny bit of my experience to help anyone who may be in the shoes I was in several months ago.  Overall (for me):  Itworks great, quite simply, it's a miracle!  With that being said, it's not easy.  Most days I'm elated.  I've never had such success and felt so good.  However, one day I had to fight to not have to go to the ER ....I let myself become dehydrated and maybe undernourished.  You must drink and keep eating.  But you live and learn.  I'm fine...more than fine.  I've been put on a maintenance dose which I have mixed feelings about because I'm only 8 pounds from my goal weight but my dr is being cautious.  Conclusion:  So far, more good than bad even though I've had many days of extreme fatigue....I think about the expensive gym memberships accompanied with diets that I tried and failed over SO many years and I'll take this over that ANY day!  But now, on a very personal note, I'm terrified because after experiencing the best summer of my life, finally close to a happy, healthy weight and lifestyle, I understand that experts say that the medication has to be continued otherwise the weight comes back without the strict discipline that I obviously was lacking pre-mounjaro.  I guess I was silly to think otherwise and I'd be happy to take the injection only once a week because I don't even feel it AT all...but insurance won't cover it and it's over a grand a month...OUCH...now that hurts.  I'm just glad I got to experience the benefits while possible.  Maybe someday this will be something that is available for everyone.  It really should be!  I really believe this drug or future versions have the ability to change the world."

The first few weeks I didn't lose any weight & had mild bloating and belching.  After the 5th week I vomitted several times and had diarrhea for a few days.  My doctor told me to stop, which I did.  11 days after my last injection and I am in hell.  Diarrhea for the 3 days and I don't mean occasional.  I'm talking about 30 times a day.  If I eat as much as one Saltine cracker my stomach rumbles like crazy, bloats up like a balloon and off to the bathroom I go. I'm sure people will lose weight if everything you eat you comes out either end right away.  The stomach pain is too much.  Hopefully this will resolve itself soon.  I'd rather die a few years earlier than have to live like this for a year or more while taking Mounjaro.  Good luck to everyone on this site.  Hopefully you'll have better luck than me.  I'm out."

I was doing keto diet, no cheating and was losing weight at a slow pace but was having to increase meds and still not able to control sugar.
Now due to Mounjaro my sugar levels are close to normal and I have lost 10 pounds in a month!!! I have had some terrible side effects but find its well worth it.  My Doctor wants to keep me on the 2.5 due to he is afraid it will cause my sugar to drop to low.  
I seem to get sick the night I take my shot and am sick  for about a day and a half before I start feeling better, again I still find it worth fighting through the side effects to get control of my life again.  I need to lose 30 more pounds and I know now I can do it all while keeping my sugar under control!"

Tirzepatide,Mounjaro,10/4/2022,LS,35-44,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,5,1,0,"This medication works. I’ve never been able to lose weight so consistently. I’ve been taking it for about 6 weeks now and am currently on the 5mg dose. Total weight loss so far: 13 pounds (201 ??188). That’s right, 13 pounds in just six weeks. Blows my mind! ?? In 2017, I lost 30 pounds over 9 months. I starved and sweated for every single one of those pounds, but they all came back the next year. I’ve tried keto, paleo, Jenny Craig, Noom - you name it, I’ve probably tired it. About 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with PCOS and it’s been a constant (losing) battle to lose weight and keep it off. I’ve been pre-diabetic several times, have elevated LDL, metabolic syndrome, etc. This medication is a game changer. One of the craziest things is I actually crave healthy foods. Yeah, you read that right. Fruits, veggies, lean protein are all I want to eat. Fried, fatty foods actually taste horrible and make me feel even worse, so it’s not hard to stay away from them. I’m no longer a slave to my sugar and carb cravings. I’ve also had IBS for over 10 years. My gut is so much happier eating smaller, healthier meals. After these meals, I am satisfied and I feel good. No more after lunch fatigue for this lady! 

Having said all of that, nothing is perfect. If someone tells you that, kick them in the shin and run because they are a dirty, rotten liar. Here are some things I’ve struggled with on the medication and how I’ve learned to manage the (minimal) side effects. First, take the medication the night before a day you can just relax. I take mine on Saturday evening because I always have Sundays off. If the medication makes me feel a bit sick, it’s always the day after the injection. Eat small, low fat meals and eat slowly. Protein shakes (plant based specifically) are also a good option. Second, water and FIBER! I can’t say it enough. Drinks tons of water and eat lots and lots of fiber. Take a fiber supplement. Whatever you need to do, because the constipation is real. Water helps with the constipation and the cotton mouth - win, win. 

I hope this review helps any of you thinking about taking the Mounjaro plunge. Go for it. ??"

Never again... was so sick the next day with nausea and muscle cramps, also could not eat anything on 2nd day.  On Day 3 I had to go to work,  so I took a Zofran.. felt much better.

I am having a little bit of constipation, but that's an easy fix. A little dry mouth, but it encourages me to drink more water. Appetite has been reduced 80%. Weird part is that I don't want many carbie foods. I am craving salads and veggies and stuff that I normally do not crave. I think because of the dry mouth, I don't want warm foods, maybe that's why I am craving salads? Its weird, but I like it really well so far. I am eating what I want, but portions are smaller because I feel full sooner. Cut out 90% of my sugar intake. So excited to see how much weight I lose.

Biggest I’ve ever gotten and blood pressure up. I was so close to having diabetes as well. Started using Mounjara the first week of August and every 4 weeks went up 2.5mg. I just took my first dose of 7.5mg 3 nights ago. This medicine makes me slightly nauseous but the Dr prescribed Zofran for me to take. It works great. I have had horrible constipation and what finally worked was using 2 tbsp of Benefiber powder daily. I also got to where I was up to 3 stool softeners, probiotics, prunes, water, laxatives….you name it. I can’t get dependent on laxatives and thank God the Benefiber worked. Last night I was awakened at 2:30am with bad nausea. My first time actually vomiting and the other end part. I just don’t know if it’s the stomach virus that is going around or the Mounjara. When I take a shot at night, I take a Zofran as well. Then the first thing the next morning before anything else, I take another Zofran. But that was it because I felt okay on the 7.5mg until my episode this morning. I will take one more dose of the 7.5mg and see if this happens again. If so, I will be going back down to 5mg. OH….and 2 months in I have lost a total of 30lbs!  This is working so I want to keep using it. Just not at the expense of being sick from a higher mg. I’ll take it slow."

I started with the 2.5mg injection.  I took that for 4 weeks, then bumped to 5.0mg for 4 weeks, and then 7.5mg for 4 weeks.  I just took my first 10.0mg dose about a week ago.  My results so far:  I weighed 210lbs when I started and currently weigh 180lbs, so I am pretty pleased with that 30lb loss.  I had no side effects up to the 7.5 dose.  However, this past week on the 10mg dose I have started to feel the abdominal pain, constant belching, bloated feeling and general gassiness that others have shared.  I will take my next dose, but if the symptoms continue, I will probably ask to go back to the 7.5 dose.  I am waiting for results of a complete blood workup, which will be available this week.  I will update once they come in.  I am pleased with my results so far and if there is a reduction in my A1C then I will consider this a significant success."

This drug is not indicated per research if there is a possibility you have a bad gallbladder.

My doctor and I have tried several different meds hoping to combat insulin resistance and overweight (I'm prediabetic) to no avail (Ozempic, Rybelsus, etc.) as well as thyroid support.  Mounjaro is the first time I have felt an actual physiological difference.  Hunger and cravings are greatly reduced, particularly on days 1-5, less so on day 6 and 7.  I have experienced few side effects.  Initially, I had a slight headache but that has resolved.  The only other side effect is my own doing when I don't take in enough calories/protein and get nauseated or fatigued.  That doesn't happen if I eat small portions more frequently.

Victoza worked for me years ago, but who wants a daily shot? Not me. Ozempic didn’t do much for me. I love Monjour. I’m not a fan of the injector pen. Sometimes I can’t tell if I really got the shot or not. Burping has been the only side effect. Reminds me of flat diet orange soda. But I have to admit I’m terribly worried about what happens when I stop the shot."

Very excited & motivated to keep on going.  Type 1 Diabetes/insulin dependence is prevalent in my family history and I would like to avoid any more on-set than I already have had with elevated A1C readings & being diagnosed as pre-diabetic.  My Dr. believed I was a prime candidate for Monjauro.  It seems I've encountered most of the issues that everyone else has with some headaches, nausea, stomach rolling, burping at times and occasional diarrhea or constipation. It usually affects me 2-3 days after taking the injection.  With the consistent progress I have made, I feel like it's worth the discomfort I have experienced at those times.  No appetite or cravings, ever, so I supplement with protein shakes & only eat balanced, small meals. I've noticed my energy level is kicking back in so this next week I'll begin walking & working out.  I'm 64, 5'5"" and began my journey at almost 192 lbs.  Already being back into the 180's so soon helps me realize that this is doable.  Not having an appetite (for the most part) has really allowed me to focus on portion control and removes the urge to grab unhealthy food/snacks.  It's been eye-opening, in comparison, to remember just how many calories I was consuming on a daily basis that were useless and put my future health at risk.  I feel I've learned a very valuable lesson to pull in the reins and make myself accountable for my choices in my eating habits.  Kudos to us all for going on this adventure and I wish everyone success and good health!"

Morning blood dropped 170 to 116 this am. Very few side effects, such as a few burps and did get low one afternoon. Significant drop in appetite until final day after first injection, but not enough to cause me to want to overeat. I have read every review on this site and gleaned good advice from all of you. Thank you all! Lots of water, smaller meals 5x a day and no more 3 large meals that might cause gastro distress.I have always been a pretty healthy eater, but I think stopping snacking and no longer having constant cravings is really helping me.

I was going to do the weight loss surgery but my body told me otherwise. I had a terrible bout of covid and a couple months later diverticulitis which resulted in a colon resection and abscess removal. After dealing with that I said no to weight loss surgery because my body had been through enough. 
With Mounjaro I have had terrible side effects. Bloating, stomach pain, acid reflux, indigestion, brain fog, exhaustion and on day 5 massive diarrhea all day long andin the middle of the night. No appetite. No cravings. I drink lots of water. I feel like I’m going through a colon clean out before having a colonoscopy lol. I’m trying to remain positive because I love the weight loss I’m seeing. I’m down 7 pounds in 6 days. 
My doc told me to take omeprazole to help with the acid so I did and that has helped. I just need to get past the diarrhea. I feel like I can’t even go to the store at this point. If you have no side effects you are so lucky! Good luck to you all. ??"

The only side effects were the first day injection of mild diarrhea and a slight headache. Both resolved within a day. 2nd injection was a super mild headache for a few hours. NO side effects with the 3rd injection. 

Much of my weight loss has been due to my bipolar medications. Seroquel especially makes me wake up ravenous for food. 

After 1 week on Mounjaro the ""Seroquel Munchies"" have completelydisappeared. I have ZERO cravings for sweets and my hunger overall has been reduced. Also, when I begin to eat I feel full after just a few bites.

I have no desire to even eat junk which has helped me try healthier foods. Friedfoods now disgust me and I am naturally craving more vegetables and fiber.

prevent muscle loss.  Highly recommend!"

I have no doubt I will reach my 60lb weight loss goal with this medication. I’m a 5’7 African American female. Started at 236lbs with a BMI of 37.

The first one made me sick to my stomach almost immediately.  It also made it very difficult to eat.  But it got better as days passed after the injection.  By the time I took the second, the nausea and loss of appetite had almost faded.  The second injection caused some of the same issues, though not as severe.  Blood sugar appears to be a good bit lower.  Not sure it is because of the drug lowering blood sugar or the nausea and lack of appetite.  I'velost about 7 pounds in a little under two weeks.  I am not taking this to lose weight and the weight loss has me a bit concerned.  I find myself trying to force food down sometimes."

I was prescribed Mounjaro for weight loss about a month ago. I previously tried Weygovy, which had terrible side effects, and Ozempic, which didn't really suppress my appetite. Since I started Mounjaro I've lost 12 lbs in 3 1/2 weeks and I am thrilled! I've had zero side effects. It really does curb your appetite. Now I only eat when I am hungry and I am easily able to trim down my portion size without feeling underwhelmed. I am no longer snacking and I don't crave my favorite junk food like before. I highly recommend Mounjaro for anyone looking for a weightloss aid!!"

I'm pre-diabetic and was prescribed off label for obesity, since I was not able to get Wegovy. For the first time in my life I am not hungry all the time, and my cravings for late night snacking are diminished to none.  I've also lost 5"" off my waist in just 3 weeks. I am able to target 1700 calories focusing on protein. It feels so easy now, whereas before my portions were out of control because nothing was 'satisfying'. Have not had any real side effects except a minor headache after the first two shots. So thankful for this medication."

The first 3 days after taking each injection: 1st week: Muscle aches/pain, HA, brain fog, indigestion, heartburn, Nausea, vomiting, fatigue. 

Weeks two and 3: all same symptoms except muscle aches.

By day 4 I feel pretty back to normal and symptom free, but the nausea and indigestion has been TERRIBLE. 

I have woken up in the middle of the night with it the most and have vomited several times. 

I am really hoping these symptoms go away. Other than that I feel it is working greatly. Curbs my appetite, feel full and satiated much sooner than I ever have, no sugar/carb cravings.

Fingers crossed it gets better!"

As a female at 5’8” I had ballooned to 275lbs in the last couple of years. I had always been able to lose weight if I just set my mind to it, but at 62 now, and not able to get my heart rate up with exercise due to a health issue, the weight was sooo slow to come off (only 1/2 lb in 3 weeks!) I was very discouraged.
I read about Mounjaro and asked my doctor about it. I received a prescription but I wasn’t sure if I could get it affordably knowing that my insurance is not going to cover a drug prescribed for weight loss. I then found on Mounjaro.com a savings card that allowed me to get the 4 injections for $25 !!!!

I understand that the substantial weight-loss usually happens at the 10 and 15 mg doses. that being said, however my blood sugars have been much better in control, not quite where we want them but, more stable. and the Dawn phenomenon high glucose numbers I have in the morning have lowered about 20 points, so that’s a win. Also I started getting hungry about 2 1/2 weeks in, then some days I wasn’t hungry and some days I was hungrier. and in the beginning for the first 2 1/2 weeks I wasn’t even really thinking about food or forgot to eat sometimes, which was kind of a nice effect, since I am a food addict in recovery in a 12 step program. I suffer GERD and IBS, and surprisingly, it hasn’t affected either one of them, I have not had any nausea either. I had tried Victoza before but I was one of the small percent of people that the medication raised my blood pressure and heart rate after about three weeks, and I had to discontinue it. Trying to not put all my eggs in one basket, but I’m hoping Mounjaro will help me not only continue lowering my blood sugars, but also getting some of this weight off, sometimes I feel screwed because I’m also going through menopause, but we’ll see!!"

The only side effect I experienced was a mild headache the first day and a half which went away on it's own.
The very first day of usage I saw a significant drop in blood glucose and my numbers continued getting better throughout the week.
I suffer from ""dawn phenomenon syndrome"" which means my sugar is usually quite high in the mornings  when I wake up. Typically I'm high 200's. After starting Mounjaro I'm now down to about 140 average.
The medicine is a MAJOR appetite suppressant and it doesn't suppress by making you sick to your stomach. You simply do not desire or crave anything and you never feel hungry. The bad part of this is you have to remind yourself to eat and sometimes I have to force myself even tho I don't feel like I want or need anything. Same thing goes for liquids. You can easily get dehydrated so be sure to drink water regularly.
I have lost 7lbs in my first week (some of that is water loss of course).
I'm very excited to continue with this medicine and see what my numbers and weight look like after 30 days."

I never experienced nausea or vomiting, but I do experience dry mouth, a horrible taste thru out the day and night and swallowing the pills is a challenge because of the taste. The benefits outweigh the cons though. I started at 200lbs and am now 180lbs. I haven't had my A1c checked since starting but I'm sure it's way down too! All in all, it's worth trying it at least!"

My A1c was out of control at 13.5 and i needed it below 9.5 just to renew my merchant mariners license. In just under a months time it dropped my A1c down to a 8.1  I was also taking farxiga, Humalog and Lantus Those alone were not doing it for me, it wasnt until i started Rybelsus that my numbers dropped. .I have yet to experience any side effects, the only con is the taste of it."

I started at 246 and I'm down to 202-203.  I had horrible nausea in the beginning and slight constipation, and every time I was upped the dosage, I felt nausea all over again and had a headache for the first few days.  When I would get full, food immediately repulsed me.  I stopped craving junk food.  I'm at month 7 and its pretty much stopped working.  I'm not losing any weight and I'm hungry all the time.  I'm craving junk food BAD.  Waiting for my insurance to approve Wegovy again.  Hopefully they will cover it.  If your insurance denies the injection, I would recommend going on Rybelsus.  Worked great for about 6 months for me."
Semaglutide,Rybelsus,10/21/2024,Anne,65-74,Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,1,1,1,1,1,0,"I first started taking felicity and that worked. But last heartbeat unavailable, so my doctor put me on rybelsus. I had really badmouthing and also Dry mouth and sticky saliva. I also had a very bad taste all day in my mouth. I also suffered really bad constipation. Rybelsus did not work for me at all. My bloods sugars were up to 17.5 most of the time. When on trulicity I lost 4stone   I didn't loose anything at all on rybelsus. It's the worst medication I've ever been on and it also tastes awful especially if you get it stuck in your throat"
Semaglutide,Rybelsus,10/17/2024,John,55-64,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,4,4,4,4,1,0,"I asked for Semaglutide because of diabetes, heart issues (stent) and for weight loss. I suppose the holy trinity of relevant ailments.  I started on 3mg and after a few months I’m now on 14mg tablets. Although it does cause side effects, namely constipation, going for a wee more at night and some nausea, the advantages are worth it. I’ve already lost 18 lbs with a target of 50. It really does blunt appetite throughout the day and I find my portions are half the size when I eat my evening meal.I’m hoping other cardio benefits (in addition to weight loss) will further increase my life expectancy and allow me to led a fuller and more active life. I also like the fact that it reduces my alcohol in-take which is probably linked to the hunger suppressor effect it has. Two glasses of red wine and I’m done. All good."
Semaglutide,Rybelsus,8/22/2024,Aged,65-74,Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,1,1,1,1,1,0,"I took it for 3 weeks and it was horrible, almost life threatening.  I went from functioning to almost bed ridden. And the trips to the bathroom all day and night I refuse to take anymore, I was really declining fast.  No appetite, dehydration , no energy pain all over my body.  This pill should not be on the market, not even for weight loss"

Semaglutide,Rybelsus,3/3/2024,Isaacx,55-64,Male,Patient,,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,1,1,1,1,1,0,"Doc prescribed this med (Rybelsus) because A1c was 9+. Took 3mg for 3 days and had terrible heart palpitations. I stopped this med immediately and symptoms went away. - I started a new diet of mostly veggies, small amounts of fruits, nuts, whole grain bread and baked meats. I no longer eat any fast food or processed-foods high in sugar and salt if I can help it. My sugar now averages 140 and below. I have lost 15 lbs in less than a month with no meds. You too can do this!"

Semaglutide,Rybelsus,2/28/2024,GoneFishing,55-64,Male,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,3,3,3,3,1,0,"I started taking Rybelsus 7mg 6 months ago as well as I had started my own plan for intermittent fasting and avoiding carbs in my diet 2 months prior to Rybelsus.  Just from the fasting (no food from 9p-9a), not eating potatoes and minimizing my bread intake I lost 20 lbs.  In the six months since taking Rybelsus I have lost another 10 lbs.  Rybelsus does seem to help me with feeling hungry less often.  However, it has also caused me several bouts - about once a month - with cramping or constipation/diarrhea.  My tips...taking the pill is easier than an injection but not by much considering how bitter it is (and if it gets stuck in your mouth or throat for any reason you'll regret it).  I also found that I had to avoid any greasy/oily/spicy foods as those seemed to bring on the cramping/upset stomach issues much faster.  Now having my A1C much lower (due to the diet change/weight loss) I'll be stopping Rybelsus soon.  It's just not worth the impact (gastroparesis) that it is having on my digestive system, in my opinion.  It wasn't a terrible medicine most of the time, but if you do experience the side effects they can be considerable."
Semaglutide,Rybelsus,2/8/2024,Jay,45-54,Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,4.333333333333333,5,4,4,1,0,"I have been taking the 3 mg for almost a year.  My A1C levels dropped.  I have lost about 32 pounds.  I have had some light headedness and nausea.  I was also taking Metformin and my doctor advised me to stop the Metformin since my concern was the light headedness.  Since stopping that, I very occasionally have some light headedness but not like I was with both Rybelsus and Metformin. Some constipation and diarrhea.  Not overly bothersome for me.  I have not noticed a metallic taste or anythinglike that.  If I feel nauseous I drink a little water or eat a little something and that helps.  I asked my doctor to keep me on the 3 mg because I tolerated it well and it did what it was supposed to do.  My appetite has decreased and I don't have the sugary cravings as often, rarely in fact.  I crave fruits more than anything on this.  I am nervous about long term effects reading all of the reviews posted.  Another reason I have asked to stay on the 3 mg.  I will see my doctor again next month to review more lab work.  This medication has been successful for me but there are a few side effects I deal with as mentioned above. Overall the medication has done what my doctor wanted it to do."

I have been on many different medications including glucophage, and injections like Victoza and last one was Trulicity. I had an allergic reaction to the Trulicity so my doctor switched me to Rybelsus. Full disclosure I am a retired RN and always research my meds and keep up with labs. 8 years ago my A1C was 11.2 and my random blood sugar was 295. I took Rybelsus exactly as recommended, starting with 30 days of 3 mg, and worked my way upto 14 mg. I am down 32 pounds but that has been over many months. I eat less, slower, low fat and very few sweets. Letting your body digest your food and not over eat is key. And I play a lot of pickle ball. I have had no side effects, and my A1C last check was 6.  I am very satisfied with the medication and will continue until my doctor says otherwise. I do wonder if I can begin to decrease the dose as my weight continues to go down."

After 3 days that stopped and I tolerated it fine. Then my doctor moved me to 7mg. After 1 week all was well but then I woke up threw up and then suffered with the worst gas and stomach cramps ever had. I am stubborn but any normal human would have went to ER. I was severely constipated for 2 weeks. Couldn't lay down because of the sharp back pains whichwas gas but at the time I thought it was ddeath.i ate nothing for 10days because the pain was Terrible.  I stopped taking it and it went away. I switched to vegan and lost 72lds naturally, A1C dropped from 6.9 to 5.6 naturally and I'll never put that drug in my body again. Especially now that I discovered how to reverse type 2 diabetes with a whole food plant based diet with very little fat. I consume nearly 800 carbs a day and less than 30 grams of fat and nearly reversed type 2 and lost a ton of weight. Look up mastering diabetes and follow what they say it's too easy. Eventually the medication will cause irrevocable damage"
Semaglutide,Rybelsus,10/12/2023,Rick,55-64,Male,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I have been taking this drug for over a year and in that time, went from 217 lbs to 172 lbs and my A1C has gone from 7.2 to 5.3.  The largest side effect has been intense constipation which I have to take other medication to mitigate.  If your A1C is higher and you have trouble getting it under control, then I definitely recommend this."

I have lost a total of 110 pounds. It truly helps with controlling your blood sugar. Prior to taking it, my A1C was 10.8 and blood sugar stayed anywhere from 250 to 300. Now, my blood sugar stays in the 80s and my A1C is down to 4.9. Yes, you will be nauseous sometimes but this medicine has literally saved my life. My doctor wants to keep me on it for another year and hopes that my diabetes will then be controlled just by diet."

I only took it for 2.5 months and in that time I had constant nausea that got worse with increased dosing, that turned into sporadic vomiting and I decided to stop it when I was laying in bed in pain from the nausea and vomiting thinking I'd be better off dead and thinking how to achieve it. That was my no more moment. Yes I lost weight, mostly because I couldn't eat without feeling sick, yes my a1c came down, but the bad effects are not worth it. Now 2 weeks afterstopping it I am in the emergency room thinking am having heart attack and am told it's a gallbladder stone. Lucky they don't recommend surgery since it's only 1 and my gallbladder isn't inflamed or infected. 12 hours at er, excruciating pain in my chest and back with non stop vomiting. Not how I'd planned my day. At home I research and see the rybelsus can take 3 months to leave body after last pill. And that it can cause gallbladder stone which is something I'd never dealt with before. I don't think this is a good drug overall."

I didn't know what to expect, other than my doctor telling me it was going to curb my appetite. Holy cow, he was right! I've been about 45 pounds overweight for over a year and it's been really difficult for me to lose. In seven days, I've already lost six pounds! 
There are some side effects which aren't that great, but I'm losing weight so fast, I don't even care. I'm mildly nauseous often and it's not a fun feeling, but the queasiness ismanageable. Also, I am only able to eat a fraction of a full plate before feeling very full. I can't eat another bite after only enjoying 1/4 of what I normally consume. My bowel movements have dramatically slowed down to every other day or so, but I'm eating so little now, my stomach has actually become flat. The constipation doesn't bother me very much. 
Overall, this experience, so far, has been amazing for me, even with the mild side effects. I've been trying to lose weight for years! 
Thank you, Rybelsus!"

Then everything else hit. Thirty six hours of extreme vomiting and severe diarrhea. Very very close calls to the bathroom. After that passed, a small meal of toast and broth. That night again severe diarrhea. Immediately stopped medicine. Imodium, bland diet and drinking Gatorade to replenish electrolytes. Day three of night leaving the house, don’t know how people could do this for months. Totally not worth it."

Semaglutide,Rybelsus,7/6/2023,Bev,65-74,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,5,1,0,Don’t eat too much at a time or you can feel like you had a Thanksgiving meal.  Much smaller meals and no stomach problems.  Hunger is at least half. Snacking does not even sound good. Pills working about as good as the shots.
Semaglutide,Rybelsus,6/28/2023,Spankie,65-74,Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,5,1,0,"I got a script for Rybelsus for weight loss because my BMI is over 30 and I have high cholesterol. I moved from a 3mg to a 7mg in four days and then to the top 14mg.  I lost 23lbs after 2 months and never had any problems except extreme constipation (you just intake more fiber to counteract this). The key is little-to-NO sugar, fat and VERY LOW carbs.  You can consumer carbs but if you keep daily consumption under 15 (just like with Keto or Paleo), your weight will drop significantly, quickly!I am on a second round after seeing if I could hold my own weight without it for several months and I only gained 5 pounds.  For me this really works since I have chronic insomnia and keep generating cortisol so it's difficult for me to lose weight any other way."
Semaglutide,Rybelsus,6/26/2023,Duane,65-74,Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,4,4,4,4,1,0,"I was on Trulicity the highest dose and when it became in short supply, my endocronologist put me on Rybelsus.  I guess I am lucky--I have had no side effects other than constipation. I had to start taking MiraLax daily which solved this issue.  I have been on it for 5 months and have lost 24 pounds. It isn't a miracle weight loss drug.  It just curbs hunger pains and makes you feel full faster, so you eat much less.  I have also found it helps with cravings--sweets and fried foods are not as tempting. it's odd, I just don't want them much any more. I do feel better over all and walk daily now.  I do think the weight loss has plateaued for now after 5 months with eating the same small meals.  It will be interesting to see if you can continue to lose weight long-term on this med.  A1-C has been brought down to 5.9.  I have had a good experience with it."

Everything came back normal , This was over a 3 month period  and several trips to ER . Steed taking it and within days all symptoms eased . It’s a little known Allergic reaction that even the Hospital didn’t know about"

It has really lowered my blood glucose, for which I am very satisfied with. Unfortunately, I actually have gained weight since beginning it. It hasn't decreased my appetite at all.

My blood sugar is averaging 112 and I've lost about 12 pounds. I do have tummy aches now and then but nothing like I had in the beginning. It slows your digestion and makes you feel very full after a few bites. I've found that the ginger chews work like magic for nausea and fullness. I will not be increasing my dose to 7mg because its not necessary. Glipizide and Metformin made my glucose levels higher and I had severe stomach pain and weight gain. While eating salads! Semaglutide is saving my life.

At first it was fine sort of helped with hunger and made cheese taste awful.  But after three months I noticed I was nauseous all the time to the point of debilitation.  I didn't suspect the medication because it was 3-4 months after I started taking it.  But after an endoscopy the doctor noted I still had food in my stomach after not eating for 18hrs.

Rybesus makes you digest food muchmuch slower than normal and was causing serious issues for me.  Two weeks after I stopped taking it I also noticed a huge mood increase.  So yes I lost 25lbs but not worth the side effects for me."

Lost 47 pounds and had no side effects. Went in for CT scan for other issue and incidentally found my right parathyroid was enlarged. Found out that taking this med can cause thyroid to enlarge.

Overall it has been managing my blood sugar along with Jardiance. My side effects are burping, bad taste, and some nausea. But not enough for me stop. I no longer have hunger pains and the need to eat all day and night. I don't really have an appetite. I have to make myself eat or snack. I have lost 5lbs so far.

I have lost 11 lbs, my blood sugar has dropped 80 points, I have no side effects at all now. The first few days, I had some slight vision blurriness, which I attribute to my rapid drop in blood sugar. I've been on metformin for years, and stayed: fat, high sugars, miserable with gastric issues, not being able to leave the house much for fear of accidents. Also, I was starving all the time, because I do not eat very much,and my stomach would empty so fast, I stayed hungry from about one hour after a meal until the next. Now, I eat three meals a day and two snacks. Still small meals because that's how I eat, but no starvation pains. The doctor is going to put me on 7mg. I'm curious as to how that will go, but right now, I feel fantastic!"

I've lost 24 pounds in 4 months, A1C from 8.9 to 6.9. Not being a slave to hunger is the biggest benefit though. On 3 mg I had zero side effects and didn't see what all the fuss was about. On 7 mg I noticed I could go hours without eating. I also did not need to eat before bed so I wouldn't wake up hungry in the middle of the night (and was sorry if I did). I had zero tolerance for anything fried, or Sulphur burpsand gas would happen (a few pieces of fried shrimp y'all, not going to happen on this drug). On 14mg - waking up in the middle of the night with stomach cramps, ending up in the bathroom projectile vomiting, started. Figured out this was 100% tied to what I ate, if not how much. You absolutely have to change your diet when taking this. Things like Caesar salad, rich pastas, subs, fried food, etc. your body will reject even if only occasional. Fruits and vegetables, garden salad, simple stir fry, grilled or baked meats are fine. Every meal is a choice you can end up regretting."

Just phasing into the 14mg dose. My A1C has gone down, I’ve lost 26 pounds so far, my liver values have improved. I haven’t had any nausea issues. I take fiber gummies every day anyway so haven’t had any issues with constipation. I don’t have any cravings anymore, I have lost any appetite for fatty, greasy or sugary foods. I eat 4/5 bites for each meal and I’m done. Rybelsus is working really well for me so far! I hope to lose enough weight to lose my diabetes and fatty liver too."

Moved on to 7mg for 1 month and now on 14mg. Other than the bad taste that would also linger all day, no other side effects until 4 months into the 14mg. Started getting severe, uncomfortableness in my upper diaphragm, just under my ribs. Feels extremely bloated, difficult to take a deep breath and bend over, increased burping, lack of appetite .. lasted a few weeks. Stopped taking for 5 days, of which 3 days in the symptoms diminished. Day 4 and 5 felt almost normal again. Tracked blood sugar through-out the 5 days, which went from 110 to 150. On day 6, took a pill and 8 hours later, symptoms came back, but blood sugar started back down, and is 143. Note: have not lost a single ounce of weight, the entire time."

You see those stupid commercials where actors tell that ""my A1C used to be here (high) and now its here (low)."" Well, I use a CGM. Before Rubelsus my ""time on target"" was 91% and since Rybelsus, my time on target is 33%. In my case, Rybelsus seems to be working the exact opposite way of the way it is supposed to; stimulation my liver to release more glucose and inhibiting my pancreas from releasing more insulin. Why did I start taking it if my time on target was 91%? Because i was taking metformin and glimeperide together and when I would sleep my blood glucose would drop dangerously low. One time it hit 30. Several times in the 40's. Quite a few times in the 50's and 60's. So I was put on Rybelsus to keep my blood glucose down in the normal range without getting to low. Well, yes, it never gets to low any more. But that is because i am in the high caution or danger area almost all the time. Rybelsus is worthless. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone."

I had a weight loss of about 20 lbs (180 down to 160).   The only thing I wish I knew when first taking it was that it had the potential to cause huge lowering of blood sugar.  I was at work when I first took it, and had a fairly sudden extreme drop in blood sugar...luckily I had plenty of glucose tablets available.  However, while I'm still taking Rybelsus, it seems to have lost its potency for me.  I'm starting to have the extreme highsand lows I experienced prior to the use of Rybelesus.

Like others I also had the GI side effects, but wanted to keep on it because it was helping my weight. After stopping the rybelsus (because of the skin soreness) the symptoms went away.

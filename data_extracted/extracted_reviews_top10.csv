I was absolutely losing weight! I gave myself shots for around a year. About month 6, I landed in the hospital with extreme dizziness to the point that I couldn't stand to move. When I say extreme, I mean, it was like I was being swung around by my foot and tossed into outer space where there's no gravity and I was spinning every direction. I landed in the hospital twice. Once I had intestinal pain with diarrhea and bleeding. At the hospital they found that I had something going on with my intestine, directly where I had given myself the shot. Stopped using my stomach and started giving my shots only in my thighs. However, the dizziness continued to come back. The ER Dr. sent me to a neurologist and what they told me was I had BPPV. Being that I had never had this issue before, I just didn't see how it just started happening out of the blue. I tried ear canalith repositioning as per the neurologist instruction when I had the episodes. Unfortunately, when it happened I would be unable to function for a week at a time before it would subside. Then it started happening more regular.
